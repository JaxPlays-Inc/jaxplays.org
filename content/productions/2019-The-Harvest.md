In the basement of a small evangelical church in southeastern Idaho, a group of young missionaries is preparing to go to the Middle East. One of them – a young man who has recently lost his father – has bought a one-way ticket. But his plans are complicated when his estranged sister returns home and makes it her mission to keep him there. What follows is a deftly nuanced piece of theatre that New York Magazine called “Passionate and funny and daring […] marvelously theatrical in a way that most serious plays about faith are not.”

"From the author of the past 5 & Dime production 'The Whale', Samuel D. Hunter returns with another searing testament of the power of religion, family, sexuality, and poverty, and the dangerous ways they intersect in our modern society." — [THE HARVEST - The 5 & Dime](https://www.the5anddime.org/the-harvest)
