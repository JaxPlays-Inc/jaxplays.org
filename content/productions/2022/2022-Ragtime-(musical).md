This much-anticipated production of *Ragtime* at Theatre Jacksonville was unfortunately cancelled due to a rapid outbreak of COVID-19 among the cast and crew. Despite implementing rigorous safety measures, the virus infiltrated this tight-knit theatre community, making it impossible for the large cast to gather safely for rehearsals.

In the midst of this health crisis, the *Ragtime* production faced a persistent hurdle — a perpetually resetting countdown for quarantine periods. With every positive test result, each affected cast and crew member would start a new five-day quarantine period. This continual cycle proved to be a formidable challenge for the entire production.

The director, Curtis J. Williams, found himself in a continuous state of adaptation and quick decision-making, trying to keep the production afloat. His days were filled with efforts to find suitable stand-ins for roles constantly becoming vacant due to the fluctuating availability of his original cast members.

This became a Sisyphean task, as no sooner would a replacement be found, another member would test positive, starting the cycle all over again. As time passed, it became increasingly clear that going forward with the show was an uphill battle. In consultation with the theatre management, the painful decision to cancel the show was made.

The cancellation was a significant disappointment for everyone involved, from the performers to the dedicated audience members.

Amid the challenges, director Curtis J. Williams was proud of an important milestone in Theatre Jacksonville's history: the first casting of openly trans and non-binary people in a production. Stemming from a heartrending conversation with a potential cast member, Williams ensured increased representation in *Ragtime*. He said, "It broke my heart that someone I know that well would even have to ask that question." Committed to the theatre as a space of inclusivity, he welcomed three individuals who identified as trans or non-binary, underlining his ethos: "If you have talent, come join us, 'cause we're a family... There is no reason for anybody to feel less than because of how you identify."
