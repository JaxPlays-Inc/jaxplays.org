'The Boys Next Door' portrays the daily challenges and simple joys of Jack, Arnold, Norman and Lucien, who live under the supervision of a caring but increasingly burned-out social worker named Jack Palmer. Through a blend of comedy and drama, the play explores the men's struggles with society's expectations, their friendships and their desires.
