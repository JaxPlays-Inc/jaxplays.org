*The White Chip* is an unflinchingly funny and moving journey through one man’s struggle with addiction and his quest for redemption. Centered on Steven, a charismatic theatre director with a seemingly perfect life, this dark comedy follows his chaotic spiral as he chases the “high” of success while battling his own demons. As Steven stumbles from one setback to the next, he finally realizes that reaching rock bottom might be his best shot at recovery. Packed with raw humor and insight, *The White Chip* offers a deeply relatable look at hitting reset and finding hope in unexpected places.
