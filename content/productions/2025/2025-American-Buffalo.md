---
*American Buffalo*, one of David Mamet’s most acclaimed plays, centers on Donny Dubrow, the owner of a junk shop, who plans to steal a valuable coin collection he believes he sold for too little. Together with his gofer and protégé, Bob and a friend, Teach, who is a volatile and dangerous con man, they plot the heist. The play intensifies as the trio’s loyalty, morality and trust unravel, exposing their desperation and the futility of their pursuit. Set over one day, this intense drama uses sharp, staccato dialogue to explore themes of greed, betrayal and the American dream turned sour.
