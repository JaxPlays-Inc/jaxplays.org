THE BITING SATIRE BY BROADWAY'S FIRST KNOWN FEMALE INDIGENOUS PLAYWRIGHT!

From Playwright LARISSA FASTHORSE: “The reality is that even when history is recorded in the moment (which is rare), we need to ask, 'Who is recording this? What are they leaving out? Who isn’t being heard?' That last question is at the heart of my life in this play.”

**NOTE:** This relentless dark comedy packs no punches while presenting the traditional American Thanksgiving story and the bloodier truth behind it. This production contains disturbing imagery and offensive depictions. Please contact Lpage@flagler.edu for more information.
