 Artist Connection Theatre is thrilled to present "Meet Me in St. Louis", a heartwarming, nostalgic musical that celebrates love, laughter, and the magic of family at Christmastime. Set in 1903 as the Smith family eagerly awaits the opening of the World’s Fair, the story follows their year of romance, change, and discovery—all leading to a touching holiday finale filled with warmth and joy. Featuring timeless songs performed by a live orchestra including “The Trolley Song,” “The Boy Next Door,” and “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” this beloved classic captures the spirit of home and the wonder of the season.
