description: |
  **Hadestown: Teen Edition** is a family-friendly adaptation of Ana√Øs Mitchell's Tony Award-winning musical designed for teenage performers, but is still the full musical. It tells the interwoven love stories of young dreamers Orpheus and Eurydice and immortal King Hades and Lady Persephone, set against a backdrop of American folk music. The story explores themes of love, loss and the journey to and from the underworld with a modern take on Greek mythology.
