From the pen of one of America’s greatest dramatists comes a searing, lyrical tale of longing, redemption, and the fleeting power of love. ABET proudly presents Eugene O’Neill’s *A Moon for the Misbegotten* — a haunting and deeply human story set on a hardscrabble Connecticut farm in the aftermath of *Long Day’s Journey Into Night*.

This powerful work follows the fierce, witty Josie Hogan and the tormented James Tyrone Jr. as they navigate a single moonlit night that holds the possibility of truth, tenderness, and emotional reckoning. As secrets unravel and defenses crumble, O’Neill crafts a raw, poetic portrait of damaged souls reaching for connection in a world that has offered them little mercy.

Written by Eugene O’Neill, the only American playwright awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and winner of four Pulitzer Prizes, *A Moon for the Misbegotten* is a cornerstone of 20th-century American theatre — intimate, elegiac, and emotionally unforgettable.

A rare chance to witness the brilliance of O’Neill’s later work, ABET’s production brings this timeless masterpiece to life with grit, grace, and honesty.
