description: "Experience the whirlwind of society, scandal and sentiment in this dynamic adaptation of Jane Austen's novel about two sisters navigating love and loss."
---
Kate Hamill’s adaptation of *Sense & Sensibility* reinvigorates Jane Austen’s classic tale with a fresh, energetic approach. The story follows the Dashwood sisters, sensible Elinor and impulsive Marianne, as they cope with the death of their father and the sudden loss of their family's fortune. Thrust into poverty and societal scrutiny, they strive to navigate a world where status and money govern the rules of love. As they encounter a series of dashing suitors, romantic entanglements, and unexpected twists, the sisters must rely on their wits, their hearts and each other to find their way through the labyrinth of high society.
