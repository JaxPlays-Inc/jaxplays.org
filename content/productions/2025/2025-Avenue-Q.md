*Avenue Q* follows Princeton, a recent college graduate with a useless degree, as he moves into a rundown apartment in a quirky New York neighborhood populated by both humans and puppets. Alongside his eccentric neighbors — including Kate Monster, wannabe comedian Brian, Christmas Eve the therapist, closeted Republican banker Rod, internet addict Trekkie Monster and the Bad Idea Bears — Princeton searches for his purpose in life. With catchy songs and tongue-in-cheek humor, the musical tackles taboo topics like love, racism and the struggles of adulthood, all delivered with warmth and wit. Winner of the Tony Award for Best Musical, it’s a satirical yet heartfelt exploration of life’s uncertainties.
