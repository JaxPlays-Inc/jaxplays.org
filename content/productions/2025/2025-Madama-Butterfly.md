*Madama Butterfly* presents the heartbreaking story of Cio-Cio San, a young Japanese geisha known as Butterfly, who falls deeply in love with an American naval officer, Lieutenant Pinkerton. Set in early 20th century Nagasaki, the opera captures their brief marriage, during which Pinkerton returns to America, leaving Butterfly waiting faithfully. Three years later, Pinkerton returns, but with devastating consequences for Butterfly who has borne him a son. The concert version of this opera focuses intensely on the score’s lyrical beauty and dramatic tension, stripping away elaborate staging to spotlight the emotional and vocal power of the performers.
