In this fast-paced, laugh-filled adaptation, the story of Dracula takes unexpected comedic turns, mixing slapstick humor with horror clich√©s. The Count faces off against the bumbling Professor Van Helsing and a cast of absurd characters all trying to thwart his sinister plans. With quick changes, witty dialogue and a clever script, *Dracula: A Comedy of Terrors* turns the gothic horror genre on its head, providing frights and delights in equal measure.
