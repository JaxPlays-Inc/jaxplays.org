*Misery* unfolds the chilling story of Paul Sheldon, a successful novelist who becomes imprisoned by his "number one fan," Annie Wilkes, after a car accident leaves him incapacitated in her secluded home. As Paul recovers, he realizes that Annie has no intention of letting him go. The tension escalates as Paul's attempts to escape become a deadly game of cat and mouse. Annie's obsession and Paul's desperation culminate in a confrontation that tests the limits of the human spirit. This intense drama captures the essence of psychological horror, providing a thrilling theatrical experience.
