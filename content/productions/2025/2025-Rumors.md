*Rumors* begins as guests arrive at the home of the Deputy Mayor of New York for his tenth wedding anniversary. The evening takes a chaotic turn when they find him wounded and his wife missing. As more guests arrive, desperate attempts to cover up the scandalous circumstances lead to a cascade of confusion and classic Neil Simon gags. With no one knowing what to believe, the party spirals out of control, culminating in a fantastically frenetic climax. *Rumors* is a masterclass in comedy, showcasing Simonâ€™s sharp wit and timing in this laugh-a-minute ensemble piece.
