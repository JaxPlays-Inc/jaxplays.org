The story kicks off with Walker Sprunt's wife, Hayley, going into labor in Alabama while he is tied up in L.A. with family chaos. Amidst a nationwide air traffic controllers’ strike, Walker finds himself stuck, but his ever-determined Mama declares, "Family Road Trip!" Thus begins an uproarious journey filled with eccentric encounters and mishaps—from alien sightings near Roswell and impromptu weddings in Texas to high-speed police chases and navigating the lively chaos of New Orleans. No obstacle is too great for Mama's unwavering mission, proving that family antics and determination can turn any crisis into a memorable adventure.
