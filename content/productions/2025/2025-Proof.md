Description: "A daughter grapples with the legacy of her brilliant but mentally ill father, questioning the line between genius and madness — and her own place in both."
---
*Proof* follows Catherine, a young woman who has spent years caring for her once-brilliant mathematician father, Robert, whose mind has been deteriorating. After his death, Catherine must deal with her estranged sister, the attentions of a former student of her father’s, and the discovery of a groundbreaking proof in Robert’s office. As questions arise about the proof’s authorship, Catherine is forced to confront her own intellect, mental stability and fears about inheriting more than just her father’s genius.
