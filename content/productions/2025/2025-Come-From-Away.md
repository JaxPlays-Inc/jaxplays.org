*Come From Away* is set in the week following the September 11 attacks and tells the true story of what transpired when 38 planes were ordered to land unexpectedly in the small town of Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador. As the world grappled with uncertainty, the town's residents opened their homes and hearts to 7,000 stranded travelers.
