---
During a total eclipse, Seymour, a meek flower shop assistant , who pines for his co-worker Audrey discovers an unusual plant he names Audrey II—one that feeds only on human flesh and blood.  

As Audrey II grows, so does the fame and fortune of the struggling flower shop, but at a gruesome cost. When Seymour accidentally kills Audrey’s abusive boyfriend, Orin, he feeds the body to the plant and soon faces the horrifying realization that his botanical creation has an insatiable hunger.

Combining 1960s doo-wop, dark humor, and campy horror, *Little Shop of Horrors* remains one of musical theatre’s most beloved cult hits.
