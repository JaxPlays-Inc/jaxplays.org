Description: "A delightfully irreverent musical comedy that follows five quirky nuns as they stage a fundraiser to cover burial costs after an unfortunate convent cooking accident."

*Nunsense* begins when the Little Sisters of Hoboken discover that their cook, Sister Julia, Child of God, has accidentally poisoned most of the convent with her cooking. Left with the task of burying their deceased sisters, the surviving nuns decide to stage a variety show to raise the necessary funds. Led by the no-nonsense Reverend Mother, each nun brings her own hilarious quirks to the stage—ranging from Sister Mary Amnesia, who can’t remember her past, to Sister Mary Leo, who dreams of becoming a ballerina. Packed with witty songs, outrageous antics and zany characters, the musical is a comedic celebration of resilience and sisterhood.
