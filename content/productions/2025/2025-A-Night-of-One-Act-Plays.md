*I Have 20 Questions and 19 Are About the Weather*, written by Mac Anderson, follows the story of two step-brothers, Wes and Matty, whose road trip through New Mexico gets unexpectedly interrupted as their car breaks down on a mountainside. Stranded without a solution, the brothers must handle strange passersby and even stranger weather patterns, all while grappling with their own differences – and the pasts they refuse to let go of.

*Hunger*, written by Ashlyn Colwell, follows the story of Princess Aelia and the siren Selena as they discover what love truly means to them. Does love at first sight truly have innocent intentions? Temptations call out from the shore as our princess Aelia faces the challenges of a stern mother, a two-faced lady in waiting, and an overbearing fiancé.
