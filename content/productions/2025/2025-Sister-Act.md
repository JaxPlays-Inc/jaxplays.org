*Sister Act* follows Deloris Van Cartier, a nightclub singer whose life takes a drastic turn when she witnesses a crime committed by her gangster boyfriend. To keep her safe, the police hide her in the last place anyone would look: a convent. Disguised as a nun, Deloris initially clashes with the rigid Mother Superior but soon brings new life to the convent’s choir with her show-stopping energy and powerful voice. As the choir becomes an unexpected sensation, Deloris finds herself drawn to her newfound community and discovers strength, purpose, and connection in the most unlikely of places—all while trying to stay one step ahead of the criminals on her trail.
