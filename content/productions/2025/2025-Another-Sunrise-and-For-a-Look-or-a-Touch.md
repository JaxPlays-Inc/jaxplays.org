---
*Another Sunrise* begins with Krystyna Zywulska, a Holocaust survivor grappling with her past as she attempts to recount her experiences on a tape recorder. Once a prisoner forced to work at Auschwitz, she recalls the unbearable choices she had to make to survive. Her narrative is a stark reminder of the horrors faced and the personal cost of survival, colored by the profound guilt of outliving those she loved.

*For a Look or a Touch* tells the story of Gad Beck and Manfred Lewin, two Jewish lovers torn apart by the Holocaust. The opera opens with an elderly Gad, haunted by the apparition of his youthful lover, Manfred. Through a blend of Manfred's journal entries and poignant flashbacks, the opera revisits their love, the visceral horrors they endured and the pervasive persecution of homosexuals during and after the war. Their story is a testament to love's endurance even in the face of the darkest human experiences.
