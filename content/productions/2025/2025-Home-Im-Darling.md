Description: "Being a domestic goddess is not as easy as it looks! *â€‹Home, I'm Darling* is a dark comedy about sex, cake and the quest to be the perfect housewife."
---
Striving for domestic bliss, Judy and Johnny choose to live a 1950s lifestyle, complete with vintage clothes, retro knick knacks and even an old refrigerator. Judy embraces the role of the perfect housewife, while Johnny works in real estate. But pressures from friends and Johnny's work threaten their idyllic life and they struggle to maintain their facade. 

The play examines the role of modern women juxtaposed with the nostalgic rose-tinted view of the past. Were things really all that wonderful in the old days?

Since its 2018 debut, *Home, I'm Darling* has received rave reviews and toured the UK, Australia in the US. It has won several awards.

"...a timely analysis of the gender divide, which manages to ask important questions about what women might want and how they might successfully find it." - The Guardian

"...sharp, funny and strikingly perceptive play..." - WhatsOnStage
