*You’ve Got Hate Mail* is a caustic romp through love, lust and digital disaster. Written by Billy Van Zandt and Jane Milmore, this quick-fire farce unfolds entirely through emails exchanged among five friends, lovers and frenemies.  

Stephanie is the wronged wife, Richard the unapologetic jerk, Wanda the “sexetary,” Ransom the obtuse but well-meaning best friend, and Martha the brash new partner. As relationships implode and inboxes overflow, secrets and scandals spill out with hilarious consequences.  

Rude, funny, and unabashedly adult, *You’ve Got Hate Mail* skewers modern romance and online oversharing — definitely not for kids or the easily offended.
