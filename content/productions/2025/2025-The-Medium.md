*The Medium* by Gian Carlo Menotti is a two-act opera that explores themes of deception, fear, and the supernatural. The story centers on Madame Flora, also called Baba, a fraudulent medium who pretends to communicate with the spirits of the dead. She operates out of her parlor with the help of her daughter, Monica, and a mute servant, Toby. During a séance, a strange and shocking event occurs that suggests the presence of a real spirit. Fear and paranoia drive Baba to suspect Toby, and in a tragic climax, she shoots him when he sneaks back into the house to be with Monica.
