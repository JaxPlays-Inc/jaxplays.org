**NOTE:** This production is a collaboration between [[theatre:The 5 and Dime]] and Swoop Troupe Theater Club at UNF. We have a Pay-What-You-Please night on March 13th at 8 p.m.

In this hilarious and outlandish story, the lives of six teenagers from a Canadian chamber choir are cut short in a freak accident aboard a roller coaster. When they awake in limbo, a mechanical fortune teller invites each to tell a story to win a prize like no other â€” the chance to return to life.
