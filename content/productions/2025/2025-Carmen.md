*Passion ignites this holiday season as First Coast Opera brings Bizet’s* **Carmen** *to life in its grandest production in 26 years. From the allure of the “Habanera” to the triumphant “Toreador Song,” the drama and unforgettable melodies have captivated audiences for generations.*

General and Artistic Director Curtis Tucker conducts and Mark Freiman directs as more than 80 artists unite in this fully staged production with orchestra, chorus, and children’s chorus.

Every performance pairs this timeless opera with the glow of St. Augustine’s Nights of Lights at Lewis Auditorium — December 31 at 7:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. matinees on January 2 and 4. On New Year’s Eve, operagoers are invited to enjoy complimentary champagne as part of the evening’s celebration.
