Description: "Plunge into the psychological depths of faith and doubt in *Agnes of God*, where a novice nun’s mysterious pregnancy sparks a complex investigation led by a court-appointed psychiatrist."
---
This gripping psychological drama centers on a young novice nun accused of infanticide. As a court-appointed psychiatrist and the convent’s Mother Superior battle over the case, they confront deep questions of faith, innocence, and mental health. At its core, this play is a subversive exploration of faith, questioning the rigidity of religious belief in the face of trauma and psychological complexity which powerfully explores belief, trauma, and redemption.
