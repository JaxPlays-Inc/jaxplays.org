Admission is free for this public table read. *Just Another Thanksgiving*, is a new play that examines family tensions through sharp humor and quiet moments of truth. This script has never been read aloud. Audiences will hear it come to life for the very first time.

Admission is free. A casual talkback will follow for anyone who wants to stay, ask questions or offer thoughts once the reading ends.
