*Ripcord* is a hilarious and heartfelt comedy from Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Lindsay-Abaire. When the upbeat Marilyn and cantankerous Abby are forced to share a room in a senior living facility, their unlikely pairing sparks a prank war that quickly spirals out of control. What starts as playful banter becomes a battle of determination, exposing vulnerabilities and forging an unexpected bond. With whip-smart dialogue and outrageous twists, *Ripcord* delivers nonstop laughs while exploring resilience, rivalry and the surprising ways friendships are born.
