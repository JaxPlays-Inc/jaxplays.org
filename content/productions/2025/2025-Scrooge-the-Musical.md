description: "Take a musical journey with Ebenezer Scrooge, the infamous miser who discovers the magic of Christmas, one ghostly visit at a time."
---
In this heartwarming musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic "A Christmas Carol," Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by three spirits on Christmas Eve. Each ghost shows him scenes from his past, present, and future to reveal the loneliness and unhappiness that come with his miserly ways. Faced with his own mortality and the harm he's done to those around him, Scrooge has a change of heart, leading to a joyful, life-affirming transformation that captures the true spirit of the Christmas season.
