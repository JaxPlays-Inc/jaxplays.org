*Rent* follows a year in the lives of young artists and bohemians living in New York’s East Village. Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a musician, navigate friendship, ambition and loss alongside their eclectic circle of friends — including Mimi, a dancer battling addiction, and Angel, a compassionate drag performer. Through soaring rock anthems and raw emotion, the musical celebrates creativity, chosen family and the urgent demand to live fully — measuring life not in years, but in love.
