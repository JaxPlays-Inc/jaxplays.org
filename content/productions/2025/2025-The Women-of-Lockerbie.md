Set seven years after the [1988 Lockerbie bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103), *The Women of Lockerbie* follows the journey of an American mother searching for closure amidst her grief. In the hills of Lockerbie, Scotland, she encounters a group of local women determined to convert an act of hatred into one of love by washing and returning the victimsâ€™ clothing to their families. Inspired by true events, this poetic and heart-wrenching play by Deborah Brevoort examines themes of loss, forgiveness, and the enduring human spirit in the face of tragedy.
