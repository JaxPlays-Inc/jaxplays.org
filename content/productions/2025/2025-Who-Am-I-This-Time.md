Based on short stories by Kurt Vonnegut, 'Who Am I This Time? (& Other Conundrums of Love)' weaves together three separate tales of love and identity. Set within the small-town setting of North Crawford's amateur theater company, characters from different walks of life find themselves cast in roles that spill over into their personal lives. From shy hardware store clerk Harry Nash who only expresses himself through his vibrant stage characters, to Helene Shaw, who seeks solace and new beginnings in the theater, each story captures the delightful and bizarre journeys of love and self-discovery.
