Description: 
---
Young housewife Nora Helmer comes to the disturbing realization that she has spent her entire marriage and indeed most of her life, pretending to be the person that her husband, her father and society expect her to be.  Ibsen’s celebrated play explores the ways that societal expectations restrict individuals, especially women.  Its success when it premiered in 1879 thrust drama firmly into the modern age. Amy Herzog’s thrilling, compact and devastatingly contemporary adaptation makes freshly relevant a story that shocked audiences and brought forth a new era of theatre.
