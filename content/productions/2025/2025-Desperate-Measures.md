Set in the late 1800s, this musical spins a tale of Johnny Blood, a charming outlaw whose life is on the line. When a lawman offers him a chance for freedom in exchange for his sister's hand in marriage to the governor, a series of wild mishaps and moral dilemmas ensue. Featuring a lively score, sharp wit, and plenty of humor, *Desperate Measures* cleverly blends classical themes with a frontier setting, resulting in a foot-stomping, feel-good musical romp.
