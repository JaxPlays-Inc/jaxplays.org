 When audiences hear the name Agatha Christie, it conjures not only a vast library of clever mysteries, but an entire world where human nature, in all its complexity, is laid bare. With only Shakespeare’s works and the Bible having reached more readers, Christie’s work has transcended generations. She didn’t just entertain; she shaped how we think about crime, morality, and justice. Murder on the Orient Express, one of her most iconic works, invites us into a glittering, enclosed world hurtling through a frozen wilderness, a place where truth and consequence collide in ways that still feel achingly relevant.

Christie’s work endures because she understood something essential. That true mysteries are not just about clever crimes and plot twists, but what it means to be human. That human life is infinitely valuable, but human decisions are rarely simple. In a time like ours, when the lines between right and wrong can feel increasingly blurred, and we are challenged daily to define and defend the value of human life, her work feels more poignant than ever.

Ken Ludwig’s masterful adaptation carries forward that spirit, inviting us into a world where truth and justice wrestle in the cold light of conscience. Murder on the Orient Express implores us to remain vigilant: to care fiercely, listen carefully, and never lose our reverence for the lives around us.

Bringing this production to life has been a labor of love in every sense. From the gorgeous period costumes, the meticulously and brilliantly crafted set, to every beat of each powerful and nuanced performance, every component was crafted with an immense passion for the spirit of Christie’s world, and with the goal of honoring the brilliance of her storytelling. I am endlessly grateful to this cast and crew, who gave their whole hearts to bringing this journey to the stage, and I could not be more proud to share it with you.

Thank you for traveling with us. In the world of Christie, nothing is ever simple, and that, perhaps, is the greatest truth of all.
