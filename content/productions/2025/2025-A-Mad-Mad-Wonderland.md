Jason Woods embodies every zany character in *A Mad, Mad Wonderland!*, from the anxious White Rabbit to the volatile Queen of Hearts, The Cheshire Cat (who might sound suspiciously like Jack Nicholson) to Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee (who might sound suspiciously like Jeff Goldblum and Alan Rickman). When the Queen of Hearts’ song vanishes, Alice braves the chaos of Wonderland & its bizarre inhabitants to save the White Rabbit from a chocolate-dipped doom, rediscovering the magic she thought she'd outgrown.
