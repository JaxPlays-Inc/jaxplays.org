*She Loves Me* is a romantic musical about two feuding co-workers at a 1930s Hungarian parfumerie who are secretly anonymous pen pals and have fallen in love with each other through letters. The plot follows their journey as they navigate their professional animosity while simultaneously exchanging heartfelt, romantic correspondence, with the central question being whether they will discover the other's identity and find love.
