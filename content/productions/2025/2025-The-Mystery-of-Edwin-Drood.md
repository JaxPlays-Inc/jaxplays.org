The Mystery of Edwin Drood is a unique theatrical experience that allows the audience to influence the outcome of the story. Set in the small English town of Cloisterham, the musical begins with the mysterious disappearance of young Edwin Drood. What makes this production distinct is its presentation as a play within a play, performed by the raucous and charismatic members of the Music Hall Royale. The intrigue deepens as the actors portraying townsfolk become suspects in Edwin’s disappearance. With each performance, the audience votes on the identity of the murderer, potentially altering the story’s conclusion. This engaging approach, combined with Rupert Holmes' witty dialogue and catchy tunes, ensures a fresh and thrilling theatrical experience every night.
