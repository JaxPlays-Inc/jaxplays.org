After a bullying incident at school, quirky and non-binary teen Penn retreats to the safety of homeschooling. During a family outing to local cave dwellings, Penn rescues an injured bat—only to discover it’s an anxious, shape-shifting vampire named Z who has a weak stomach and a distaste for blood.  

As Penn attempts to help their new friend, chaos ensues: a pack of rowdy vampires hunts for their lost sibling, Penn’s perfectionist sister battles for the science fair title and junk food fuels the madness.  

Written by Ian Mairs, *Toothless: A Halloween Treat* pays homage to the offbeat comedies of the 1980s while exploring themes of identity, belonging and humor amid the spooky season. Recommended for ages 10 and up.
