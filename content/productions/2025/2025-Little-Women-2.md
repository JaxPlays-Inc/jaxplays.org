*Little Women*, the musical, brings to life the enduring story of the March sisters - Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy - as they grow up in Civil War America. The story is centered around Jo March's struggle to become an independent and successful writer, reflecting the aspirations and challenges of each sister. With their father away at war, the sisters rely on their strong-willed mother, Marmee, to guide them through hardships and adventures. The musical beautifully interweaves the personal ambitions and romances of the sisters with poignant moments and spirited music, celebrating themes of resilience, love and family unity.
