Last year's production of It's a Wonderful Life A Live Radio Play delighted audiences and left them asking for more, so we're bringing back the live radio format!

Based on the 1948 radio play Miracle on 34th Street, we recreate the magic complete with live sound effects and holiday jingles!
When a department store Santa claims he’s the real Kris Kringle, his case gets taken all the way to the Supreme Court. Watch the miracle unfold when the belief of a little girl makes all the difference in this iconic story.

“All in all, this show is a delightful way to get into the holiday spirit and believe in Santa, magic, and imagination again just in time for this holiday season.” -  Broadway World
