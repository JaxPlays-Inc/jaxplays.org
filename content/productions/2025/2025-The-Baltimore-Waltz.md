*The Baltimore Waltz* is a touching narrative about Anna, a schoolteacher diagnosed with a terminal illness, and her brother Carl, who decide to embark on a whirlwind tour of Europe. The play is a fantastical and satirical journey that serves as Annaâ€™s whimsical response to her diagnosis, exploring themes of love, loss, and the desire to live life to the fullest. Through their travels, they encounter a host of eccentric characters and situations that mirror their fears and dreams. Paula Vogel's play is a heartfelt tribute to her own brother, blending reality with fantasy in a poignant exploration of sibling bonds and the impact of illness.
