Description: "Step into the gritty world of Victorian London in this musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' 'Oliver Twist,' where a young orphan navigates the perils of the city's underworld."
---
*Oliver!* brings to life Charles Dickens' classic tale of Oliver Twist, a young orphan who escapes a dreary workhouse only to find himself entangled with a group of pickpockets led by the cunning Fagin. As Oliver tries to navigate his new, perilous environment, he encounters colorful characters like the Artful Dodger, the sympathetic Nancy, and the menacing Bill Sikes. The musical juxtaposes the innocence of Oliver with the harsh realities of 19th-century London, enhanced by memorable songs like "Consider Yourself," "Food, Glorious Food," and "You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two." This powerful story explores themes of exploitation, bravery, and the search for family and belonging in a world that often seems devoid of kindness.
