"One Man, Two Guvnors" is a Tony Award-winning British comedy play by Richard Bean, based on the classic Italian commedia dell'arte. Set in Brighton, England in the 1960s, the play follows the adventures of Francis Henshall, an easily confused but ambitious man who finds himself working for two different bosses who do not know about each other. Chaos ensues as Francis tries to keep his two jobs a secret and satisfy the conflicting demands of his two guvnors. With hilarious slapstick humor, witty wordplay, and clever twists and turns, "One Man, Two Guvnors" is a raucous and entertaining comedy that will leave audiences in stitches. The show also features music from the skiffle band "The Craze," adding to the vibrant and lively atmosphere of the play.
