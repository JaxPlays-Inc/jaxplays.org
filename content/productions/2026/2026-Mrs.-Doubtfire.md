*Mrs. Doubtfire* follows the desperate antics of Daniel Hillard, a loving but eccentric father who faces losing custody of his children amid a messy divorce. In a last-ditch effort to spend time with them, Daniel transforms himself into the prim and proper Scottish nanny, Euphegenia Doubtfire. What starts as a simple disguise evolves into a life-changing experience for Daniel and his family, as he learns more about his childrenâ€™s lives and begins to mend the fractures in his family. The musical blends humor, emotion, and a touch of madness, featuring catchy songs and dynamic performances that celebrate the lengths one will go to for love.
