Amelia Island Opera presents a witty and poignant concert evening combining **Menotti’s** light one-act opera *The Telephone* with **Gabriel Kahane’s** song cycle *Craigslistlieder*. In *The Telephone*, Ben (John Tibbetts) struggles to propose to his distracted fiancée Lucy (Kyaunnee Richardson), hindered by her incessant phone use. After intermission, Richardson and Tibbetts join tenor Dylan Elza to perform *Craigslistlieder*, a contemporary cycle that transforms real Craigslist ads into surprising, humorous and moving musical vignettes.  

Directed by Bill Ivins and accompanied by Music Director Keith Chambers, this double bill asks how connection, love and misunderstanding coexist in our wired world.
