  A timely comedy about a mumps outbreak at a progressive school that prides itself on consensus decisions.
---

A mumps outbreak forces a private, progressive elementary school's Board of Directors to make difficult choices that won't please everyone. This wildly relevant and bitingly funny portrait explores mandatory vaccinations, facts becoming subjective, and the central question of building consensus when no one can agree on truth.
