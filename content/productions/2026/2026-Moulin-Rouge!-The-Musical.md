*Moulin Rouge! The Musical* transports audiences to the heart of Montmartre, Paris, at the turn of the 20th century. Here, the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub teeming with artists, aristocrats and workers, is where the young writer Christian falls for the enchanting courtesan Satine. As they fight for their love, they must navigate a world of excess, jealousy and danger, underscored by a soundtrack that blends contemporary hits with the atmosphere of the Belle Époque.
