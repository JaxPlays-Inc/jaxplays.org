Set in a comfortably upper middle class living room in the mid 1970s, the play revolves around John, a playwright seeking his family's blessing for a new play that reveals disagreeable family secrets. During the ritual cocktail hour, martinis flow along with recriminations and revelations, both funny and poignant.
