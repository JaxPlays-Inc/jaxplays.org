#### Note: Date is not finalized.

When former lovers are cast opposite each other in a swoony 1930s melodrama, the lines between performance and reality begin to blur — with hilarious and heartfelt consequences. ABET presents Stage Kiss, a witty, whimsical, and slyly subversive romantic comedy from one of America's most celebrated contemporary playwrights, Sarah Ruhl. Smart, self-aware, and surprisingly moving, Stage Kiss is part backstage comedy, part love letter to the stage, and all heart. It's a perfect piece for actors and audiences who love theatre — and love laughing at it.
