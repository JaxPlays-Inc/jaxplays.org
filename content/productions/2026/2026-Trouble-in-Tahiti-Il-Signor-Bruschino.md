Amelia Island Opera presents a striking double bill: Leonard Bernstein’s *Trouble in Tahiti* and Rossini’s *Il Signor Bruschino*.

In *Trouble in Tahiti*, we enter the tony, manicured streets of suburban 1950s America to see a marriage unravel under the pressure of emotional isolation, disillusionment and yearning. In the second half, Rossini’s *Il Signor Bruschino* brings comic relief through mistaken identities, spirited youth and farcical intrigue.

Directed by Scott Skiba and conducted by Keith Chambers, this contrasting evening offers both emotional depth and delightfully clever mayhem.
