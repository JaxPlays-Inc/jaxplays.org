Description: "A mysterious sword, a reluctant hero, and a powerful secret collide as Merlin guides Arthur toward a destiny he never wanted — but cannot escape."
---
Britain, 500 A.D.—a violent storm, a legendary sword, and a kingdom on the brink. This electrifying retelling of the Arthurian legend thrusts a young Arthur into a world of ancient magic and rising danger, where prophecy stirs, loyalties are tested, and the fate of a nation hangs in the balance.
