Looking to get out from under his overprotective mother's influence, Don Baker, blind since birth, decides to move out on his own into an apartment in Manhattan. But when he becomes involved with his neighbor, a kooky and sexy actress named Jill, Mother can't stay out of the mix in this classic play that leads to hilarious and touching results!

“A charming play... humorous, winning and quietly moving.” – New York Post
 
“A lovely play. It is funny when it means to be, sentimental when it is so inclined, and heartwarming.” – New York Daily News
