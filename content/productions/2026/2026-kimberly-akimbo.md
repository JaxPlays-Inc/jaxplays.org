Kimberly Levaco is about to turn 16 but physically appears elderly due to a progeria-like condition. With a dysfunctional family including a hypochondriac mother and scam-artist aunt, she navigates first crushes and friendships while determined to find happiness against all odds. A poignant story about appreciating life despite its challenges.
