A family is thrown into chaos when a provocative photographer challenges their ideas of identity and self-expression. At the center is Jared — a brilliant, socially isolated young man on the spectrum — fighting to be seen on his own terms. A darkly funny, deeply humane portrait of what happens when the need to be seen collides with the fear of being truly known.

“An impressive and beautiful meditation on the mysteries of being moved.” — The New Yorker
