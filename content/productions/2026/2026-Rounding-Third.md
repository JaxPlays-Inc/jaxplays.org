*Rounding Third* is a comical journey of two Little League coaches through an entire season, from their first tentative meeting to the climactic championship game. A stand-in for the team, the coaches speak directly to the audience about competition, character, punctuality, and the importance of wearing the right equipment.
Don is the tough, blue-collar, win-at-all-costs veteran coach whose son is the star pitcher. Michael, a corporate executive and newcomer to both the town and baseball, agrees to be Don's assistant in order to have a special activity with his son, who's never played baseball before.
Michael believes coaching is all about everyone having a good time, Don thinks it's about teaching the kids to win.
This is where the play takes off and real issues emerge. How should we raise our kids? Do we teach them that winning is everything or protect their childhood as long as possible? In facing these questions, both men also grapple with their own lives and inner conflicts of what being a dad is all about.
 
"As a writer, Dresser embodies the ability to channel the voices of real people. You will recognize your neighbor, your brother, and maybe yourself." -nytheatre.com
 
Their clash of styles and wills drives this funny, acerbic and touching play through the bumpy terrain of fatherhood and baseball." - Playbill
