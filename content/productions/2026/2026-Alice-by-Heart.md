**NOTE:** This production is a collaboration between [[theatre:The 5 and Dime]] and [[theatre:Swoop Troupe]] Theater Club at UNF.

From the creators of Spring Awakening, *Alice by Heart* is a bold reimagining of Alice in Wonderland, set in an air raid shelter during the London Blitz and pulsing with indie-rock energy, aching nostalgia, and wild theatricality. A testament to the power of imagination during the darkest of times.

“A fantastical, magical mystery tour with Noel Coward-ish wit, and dreamy songs which suggest the Beatles’ hallucinogenic period.” — The New York Times
