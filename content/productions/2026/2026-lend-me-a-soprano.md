  A hilarious backstage farce about an opera company's one-night performance of Carmen gone hilariously awry.
---

Lucille Wylie, manager of the Cleveland Grand Opera Company, prepares for a one-night-only performance of Carmen starring world-famous soprano Elena Firenzi. Things go awry when Elena arrives late, her jealous husband Pasquale shows up and passions flare! It's up to Jo, Wylie's clever assistant, to save the day. Full of mistaken identities, romantic entanglements and backstage chaos, but at heart a beautiful story of mentorship and self-discovery.
