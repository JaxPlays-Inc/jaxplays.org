When Macy's department store hires a new Santa Claus for the holiday season, customers are charmed by his authenticity. But when Kris Kringle claims he's the real Santa, he finds himself in a courtroom battle to prove his identity. This heartfelt drama stirs up the magic of Christmas, questioning whether faith is a matter for the courtroom or the heart.
