The Twelve Days of Christmas transforms the beloved carol into an adventurous quest led by Shirley the Partridge. Her first time orchestrating the family tradition of singing "The Twelve Days of Christmas" quickly turns haywire. With the French Hens bickering, the Geese a-Laying sunbathing in Florida, and the Calling Birds on strike, Shirley's already in a tizzy. But the real crisis hits when the Five Golden Rings go missing, swiped by the nefarious Christmas Hoarder! Along with Alyssa, a steampunk swan, Shirley embarks on a mission full of quirky twists and delightful turns. Can they outsmart the Christmas Hoarder and restore the holiday spirit? This vibrant, modern twist on the classic song is a heartwarming reminder that sometimes breaking tradition can bring its own kind of joy.
