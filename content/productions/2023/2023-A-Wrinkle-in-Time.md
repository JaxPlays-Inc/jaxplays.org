In this gripping adaptation, A Wrinkle in Time transcends its origins as a beloved children's book to offer a metaphysical adventure that poses questions about love, sacrifice, and the fabric of reality. Young Meg Murry embarks on an interstellar quest to find her missing father. Guided by a trio of cosmic entities, she navigates a universe more complex and dangerous than she could have ever imagined. As malevolent forces loom ever closer, it's a fight not just for her family but for the fate of all existence.
