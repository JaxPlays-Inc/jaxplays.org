A unique love story, the play chronicles the emotional and romantic journey of Doris and George, who rendezvous once a year at a cozy inn. Despite being married to other people, their annual tryst becomes a touchstone for their lives, revealing the poignant turns and laugh-out-loud humor in their relationship. Each year brings new revelations, opportunities for personal growth, and of course, the inevitable complications. Through the years, they develop an emotional intimacy deeper than what one would expect to find between two people meeting for a clandestine relationship just once a year. The play ran four years on Broadway, winning a Tony Award for lead actress Ellen Burstyn, who later recreated her role in the successful motion picture. The play is a funny, touching, and ultimately compelling story of two people who, despite the odds, form a deep and lasting attachment to one another.
