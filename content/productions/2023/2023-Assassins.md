A carnival shooting gallery serves as the eerie backdrop where nine infamous assassins, or would-be assassins, of U.S. Presidents converge. With a tuneful Sondheim score as their soundtrack, they tell their overlapping stories, debating the merits and flaws of the American Dream, one bullet at a time.
