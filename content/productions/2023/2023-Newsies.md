Description: "Seize the day with the Newsies, as young paperboys stage a strike against media moguls in this high-energy musical."
---
Based on the real-life Newsboy Strike of 1899, Newsies combines history and song into a dynamic tale of underdogs fighting the system. Catchy tunes and high-kicking dances punctuate this story of courage, comradeship, and the quest for fair treatment.
