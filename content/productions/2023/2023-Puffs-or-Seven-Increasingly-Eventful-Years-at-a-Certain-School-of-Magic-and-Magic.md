Description: "In the shadows of wizards and chosen ones, the Puffs strive for a normal magical education, albeit with their own whimsical misadventures. A love letter to magic, misfits, and friendship."
---
Meet the Puffs, a lovable group of magical misfits who don't quite fit in with their more famous wizarding counterparts. For seven years, they navigate the highs and lows of a magical education filled with spells gone wrong, awkward encounters with dark forces, and the daunting challenge of exams. It's a hilariously heartfelt journey that celebrates the importance of friendship and finding your own path, even in a world where you're overshadowed by legends.
