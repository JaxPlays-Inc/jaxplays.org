When a straight-laced couple, Brad and Janet, find themselves with a flat tire during a storm, they seek shelter in a mysterious castle. What they discover is an eccentric and flamboyant Dr. Frank-N-Furter and his equally bizarre housemates. Prepare for a night of absurdity, laughter, and dance as you dive into this cult classic.
