Navigating the challenges of a modern family, Dotty, the aging matriarch of the Shepard family, grapples with Alzheimer's. Her children come home for the holidays, each carrying their own baggage. Shelly, the eldest, takes on the maternal role but resents it, while Donnie and his husband struggle with a failing marriage. Averie provides comic relief but often at inappropriate times. As Dotty's memory fades, the family must come to terms with their changing roles and find grace in imperfection.
