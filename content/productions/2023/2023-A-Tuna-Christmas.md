In the small, quirky town of Tuna, Texas, it's Christmas Eve and holiday shenanigans are at an all-time high. Radio station personalities Thurston Wheelis and Arles Struvie report on various festivities, from the Christmas lawn display contest to the mysterious "Christmas Phantom," known for vandalizing the displays. As the characters, all played by only two actors, navigate love, loneliness, and fruitcake, the audience is treated to a hilarious, heartfelt, and utterly unique holiday experience. Buckle up, it's going to be a wild, festive ride!
