Sandy, the four-times-divorced chapel owner, has seen her share of matrimonies. From runaway brides to secret agents, her clients are a motley crew with one thing in common: the search for unconventional love. As Sandy navigates these wacky nuptials with Marvin, her Elvis-impersonating minister, each wedding takes an unexpected turn. When it's Sandy's turn for a surprise romance, will love finally be in the cards for her?
