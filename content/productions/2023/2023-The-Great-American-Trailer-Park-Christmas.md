When the quirky residents of Armadillo Acres try to glam up their mobile home community for the holidays, an unexpected guest throws everyone for a loop. Between tacky lawn ornaments, stolen decorations, and a competitive decorating contest, it's a Christmas like no other. Get ready for an uproarious, heartwarming celebration of what makes a community a family, even when that family is more than a little dysfunctional.
