Description: "Get ready to laugh until you drop...dead. This cheeky adaptation brings new life—and laughs—to the iconic zombie apocalypse tale."

Mark Landon Smith's Night of the Living Dead delivers a hilarious spin on the classic horror story. Zombies are still very much a threat, but this time, they might just die laughing—or make you do so. When survivors hole up in a farmhouse, comedic mayhem ensues. It's a fresh take on a gory tale, showing that even in a zombie apocalypse, humor is the best survival tool.
