*The Addams Family* sees a significant change when Wednesday Addams, the ultimate princess of darkness, falls for a sweet, smart young man from a 'normal' family. As the two families converge for a fateful dinner, hilarity and drama unfold, leading the Addams clan to confront what it means to be 'normal.'
