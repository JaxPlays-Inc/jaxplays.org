It's Christmastime 1936, and renowned Broadway star William Gillette, best known for his role as Sherlock Holmes, has invited friends and fellow actors to his opulent, Connecticut mansion for a holiday soir√©e. But when a guest ends up dead and a snowstorm entraps everyone inside, Gillette must channel his inner detective to solve a murder most foul. The lines between theater and reality blur as Gillette takes on the persona of his famed character, Sherlock Holmes, to crack the case. But when the spotlight turns on him, will Gillette manage to keep his cool or become the next victim in this dangerous charade? The game, as they say, is afoot! Loaded with twists, wit, and suspense, The Game's Afoot serves up a thrilling whodunit, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats until the final bow.
