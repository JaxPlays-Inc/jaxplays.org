Description: "A clash of convictions and culture fuels this electrifying story that dances between defiance and discovery. Rebellious dancing meets small-town politics, igniting a movement that shakes the ground and hearts alike."
---
Ren McCormack moves to a sleepy town where dancing is banned. Struggling to fit in, Ren challenges the status quo, sparking a dance rebellion among the youth and teaching the town to let loose. Armed with irrepressible spirit and the beat of a different drum, Ren rallies the communityâ€™s youth as he fights for change. With classic 80s hits propelling the action, Footloose cuts loose in a story about shaking up the norm and finding your own rhythm.
