Sung in Italian with English Supertitles

Set against the backdrop of a 17th-century Italian convent, Suor Angelica is a heartrending tale of loss, repentance, and ultimate redemption. Sister Angelica, once a woman of nobility, now devotes her life to penitence and prayer, isolated from the world and her own past. The unexpected arrival of a visitor unravels her tightly held secrets, leading to a devastating climax. Puccini's soul-stirring opera delivers an emotional wallop, as it explores the complexities of guilt, despair, and the search for forgiveness.
