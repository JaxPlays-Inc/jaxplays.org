It’s a dark and stormy night at Boddy Manor, where six eccentric guests have been invited to dinner—and murder is on the menu. *Clue*, based on the cult-favorite film and classic Hasbro board game, brings the world’s most beloved mystery to life on stage.

When their mysterious host winds up dead, Wadsworth the butler leads the guests through a hilarious evening of chaos, confusion, and colorful suspects. Who killed Mr. Boddy? And with what weapon?
