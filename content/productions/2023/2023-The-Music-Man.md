synopsis: Enter Harold Hill, a swindler with the "right credentials" and a grand scheme to con the folks of River City, Iowa, into buying instruments for a boys' band he has no intention of forming. His plan hits a sour note when he falls head-over-heels for Marian, the savvy librarian. As he's caught between love and larceny, Harold must decide whether to stick to his scam or change his tune for a shot at real love.
