It's World War II, and the renowned Andrews Sisters are scheduled to lift spirits with their iconic harmonies at a USO show. But when illness strikes the trio, all hope seems lost. Enter the Andrews Brothers, stagehands who are not just handy behind the scenes but also a dab hand at a high note. Armed with wigs, makeup, and unparalleled chutzpah, they set out to fool the audience and save the day. Filled with swingin' hits, laughs that pack a punch, and puns that swing both ways, The Andrews Brothers offers a wartime twist that's as patriotic as it is hysterical.
