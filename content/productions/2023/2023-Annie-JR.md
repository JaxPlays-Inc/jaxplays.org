In the depths of the Great Depression, young Annie is determined to find her parents who left her at an orphanage run by the cruel Miss Hannigan. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she's selected to spend Christmas at the mansion of the mysterious industrialist Oliver Warbucks. The junior version of this heartwarming tale captures the resilience of youth and the magic of finding a place to call home.
