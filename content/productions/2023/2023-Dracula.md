Enter a world where the line between the living and the undead blurs. FSCJ DramaWorks presents an enthralling stage adaptation of Orson Welles' radio play, Dracula. Experience the spine-tingling drama as the Mercury Theatre's vintage narrative is theatrically reborn, complete with suspenseful pauses, haunting sound effects, and bone-chilling performances. It's vintage radio horror, live on stageâ€”minus the static but plus all the chills.
