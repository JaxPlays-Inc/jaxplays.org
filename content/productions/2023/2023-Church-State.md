---
Three days before his re-election, a US Senator has a life-altering crisis of faith which sends the entire campaign into a tailspin. He decides to finally tell the public exactly what’s on his mind, no filter. What could possibly go wrong?

His wife and campaign manager try to contain the damage, but in a country where religion influences politics and politics have become a religion, how do you reach the people and stay true to yourself? A timely and fast-paced story that is simultaneously funny, heartbreaking, and uplifting.
