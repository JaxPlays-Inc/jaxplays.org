Sister Aloysius, a stern and traditional school principal, suspects the friendly Father Flynn of improper conduct with one of the male students. Enlisting the help of Sister James, a young and naive teacher, Aloysius embarks on a mission to expose Flynn. Yet, as new evidence comes to light, certainty wavers, making room for moral ambiguity. Who is the sinner and who is the saint? In this riveting drama, it's hard to tell, but doubt will linger long after the curtain closes.
