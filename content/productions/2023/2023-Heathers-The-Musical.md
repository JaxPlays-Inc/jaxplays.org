Description: "*Heathers: The Musical* is where high-school angst meets murderous mayhem—take the 'scrunchie' of power, if you dare."
---
In the vicious social jungle that is Westerberg High, Veronica Sawyer finds an escape route from the tyranny of the Heathers—the ruling trio of mean girls—when she meets the dark and mysterious J.D. Together, they give "teen angst" a deadly new meaning. With catchy songs and dark humor, this musical explores the chaos of adolescence, love, and the very questionable decisions we make when navigating high school hierarchies.
