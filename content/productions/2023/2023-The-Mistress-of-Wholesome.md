Description: "In this comedic whirlwind of marital mischief, an antique musket isn't the only thing that fires when a mistress holds a wife hostage."
---
Margaret, desperate for a child, is playing the role of a doting wife to win favor in the adoption process. Gwen, her husband Leland's mistress, has other plans. Armed with an antique musket, Gwen takes Margaret hostage in her own home, demanding her husband's affections back. Just when you think it can't get any crazier, an adoption agent shows up for an interview. Oh, and did we mention Leland is locked in the trunk of Gwenâ€™s car across town? Two women, one outrageous plan, and a ticking clock make for a one-act play that's anything but wholesome.
