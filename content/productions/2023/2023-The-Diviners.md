Buddy Layman, a mentally challenged boy with a fear of water, has a gift for divining water locations. When disillusioned preacher C.C. Showers comes to town, the two form an unlikely friendship. Showers promises to build a church but gets tangled in the town's expectations and his own redemption journey. As the town leans on miracles and Buddy begins to trust again, a heartbreaking calamity forces everyone to confront their own notions of faith and redemption.
