"Based on a true story, Grace works for the U.S. Radium Corporation, painting dials on watches. She is taught to twist the glowing paintbrushes with her mouth to get the perfect lines on each watch. Grace’s coworkers fall ill and die from mysterious causes; always explained or hidden by U.S. Radium Corporation. Did the women know each drop of paint was killing them? Grace fights against everyone for her day in the courtroom and all their rights." — [Radium Girls by D.W.
