"After their wildly successful production of A New Brain during their inaugural season downtown, The 5 & Dime continues to explore the works of James Lapine & William Finn with their groundbreaking, Tony Award-winning musical Falsettos. This whirlwind story revolves around the life of a charming, intelligent, neurotic gay man named Marvin, his wife, his lover, his about-to-be-Bar-Mitzvahed son, his psychiatrist… and the lesbians next door. Set in New York before and during the AIDS crisis of the early 80’s, Falsettos proves with equal doses of comedy and heart that family - as non-traditional as it may be – always comes first. It’s a hilarious and achingly poignant look at the infinite possibilities that make up a modern family… and a beautiful reminder that love can tell a million stories." — [FALSETTOS - The 5 & Dime](https://www.the5anddime.org/falsettos)
