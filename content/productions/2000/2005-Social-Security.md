In *Social Security*, Barbara and David Kahn, a trendy Manhattan art gallery couple, find their chic urban lifestyle disrupted when Barbara's conservative sister Trudy deposits their eccentric mother, Sophie, on their doorstep. The unexpected visit sets off a series of comedic events that challenge the family's relationships and perceptions. As Sophie's spirited influence begins to transform everyone around her, the play explores themes of family, aging, and the vibrant pursuit of passion at any stage of life. With sharp wit and a lot of heart, *Social Security* offers an entertaining look at the clashes and connections that define family life.
