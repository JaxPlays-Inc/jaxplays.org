In the cozy Lapin Agile, frequented by the bohemians of Paris, a young Picasso and Einstein find themselves in a spirited debate about the value of art and science. As the patrons take sides, the two great minds clash, spar, and eventually find common ground in unexpected ways. The evening takes a surreal turn when a time-traveling visitor arrives, setting off a chain of events that challenge our perceptions of fame, fortune, and the nature of genius."
