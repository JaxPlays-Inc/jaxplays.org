'POTUS' follows the frenetic and farcical events that unfold when a public relations nightmare threatens the presidency. As the President's all-female staff scrambles to control the situation, they navigate a series of outrageous crises, power struggles and media frenzy. With sharp wit and rapid-fire dialogue, Selina Fillinger's play offers a side-splitting look at the inner workings of political power and the formidable women who keep it all together.
