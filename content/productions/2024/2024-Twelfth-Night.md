Description: "Shakespearean love triangles and identity crises unravel in this timeless comedy set in the imaginary land of Illyria."
---
A shipwreck, separated siblings, and tangled romancesâ€”Shakespeare's Twelfth Night is a whirlpool of love and deception. Set against the backdrop of the enchanted Illyria, the play is a riotous journey of unrequited love, mistaken identities, and comic revelry.
