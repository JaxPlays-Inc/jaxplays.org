When the heir to a vast fortune falls victim to what appears to be a diabolical family curse, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson venture into the treacherous moors to crack the case. In this uproarious adaptation, *Baskerville* turns Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic narrative into a fast-paced comedy.

This comedic whirlwind challenges the detective duo to fend off danger and hilarity alike, ensuring the safety of the next heir before the mythical hound strikes again.
