Description: "Fasten your seatbelts for a turbulent comedy where love is up in the air, and timing is everything. Boeing Boeing is a jet-setting farce that whirls through the highs and lows of romantic deception."
---
Set in the swinging 1960s, this hilarious comedy follows the life of Parisian bachelor Bernard, who is juggling secret engagements to three international air hostesses. With careful planning and the unreliable schedules of the airlines, his love life runs like clockwork. That is until the introduction of faster planes and a surprise visit from an old school friend brings his precise life to a screeching halt. As Bernard's carefully separated worlds begin to collide, the resulting chaos is a first-class ticket to laughter, making Boeing Boeing an unmissable comedic flight.
