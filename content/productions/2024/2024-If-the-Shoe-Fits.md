Description: "Step into a zany world of love, murder, and footwear with 'If the Shoe Fits,' where a seemingly simple plan spirals into a hilariously twisted comedy."
---
It all starts when Delores, a disenchanted housewife, and George, a charismatic shoe salesman, discover mutual attraction at Shoe Fantasy. Plotting to rid themselves of Delores' simple-minded husband Marvin to pursue a dream life together in paradise, they concoct a plan to poison him during a dinner. Things escalate into comic chaos as Marvin repeatedly evades their clumsy attempts on his life, and Esperanza, the quirky maid, complicates matters with her own infatuation with George. Filled with misdirected passions and mistaken identities, *If the Shoe Fits* delivers uproarious laughter and a witty exploration of love and deception.
