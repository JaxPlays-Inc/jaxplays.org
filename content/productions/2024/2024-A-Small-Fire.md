Description: As illness dims her senses, Emily's grasp on life and relationships transforms, revealing unexpected strength.
---
Emily Bridges, a tough and successful construction company owner, finds her no-nonsense approach to life, work, and family put to the test when a mysterious illness begins to strip away her senses one by one. As she grapples with her diminishing independence, the relationships with her husband John, daughter Jenny, and longtime employee Billy come into sharper focus. *A Small Fire* navigates the unpredictable changes life can bring, and the ways in which adversity can redefine love, reveal strength, and transform perspectives.
