*Alabama Story* plunges you into the tempestuous era of the Civil Rights movement, where a children's book becomes the center of an ideological war. This gripping drama unfurls in two parallel narratives: one follows the public clash between a segregationist State Senator and a fearless State Librarian; the other uncovers the private struggles of childhood friends, now adults, separated by race and reunited by destiny. This thought-provoking story invites you to witness the raw intersection of public policy and personal conviction. Based on true events, it's a vivid reminder of how far we've come and how much further we have to go.
