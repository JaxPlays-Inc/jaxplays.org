*Mame In Concert* brings the beloved musical to life in a unique format, focusing on its iconic score and the larger-than-life character of Mame Dennis. Set against the backdrop of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression, Mame's adventurous spirit never wanes as she faces life's ups and downs with zest and zeal. This concert production highlights the musical's most memorable moments and songs like "Bosom Buddies" and "If He Walked into My Life," performed by a dynamic cast accompanied by a live orchestra. 

Florida Theatre and Theatre Jacksonville present an "in concert" production of the musical *Mame*. Set in mid-20th century New York City, Mame Dennis is an eccentric bohemian with wealthy friends whose fabulous life is interrupted by the arrival of the young son of her late brother. The plot covers their adventures from the beginning of the Depression through WWII. With a book by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee, the music and lyrics by Jerry Herman include "We Need a Little Christmas," "Bosom Buddies," "If He Walked Into My Life," and one of the best-known title songs of the American Musical Theatre, "Mame."

This "in concert" Broadway production features a full 26-piece orchestra on stage with a 30-member chorus, conducted by Jacksonville native Joey Chancey, whose Broadway credits include *An American in Paris*, *Beautiful: The Carole King Musical*, *Gigi*, and *Annie*.

Linda Purl stars as Mame. Her Broadway credits include The *Adventures of Tom Sawyer* and *Getting and Spending*. She is best known for screen roles as Fonzie’s girlfriend, Ashley Pfister, on *Happy Days*, Pam Beesly’s mother, Helene, on The Office, and Ben Matlock's daughter, Charlene, on *Matlock*.

Dorothy Bishop co-stars as Mame’s best friend Vera Charles. A Jacksonville native, she appeared in the first Broadway national tour of Terrence McNally’s *Master Class* opposite Faye Dunaway and is best known in NYC for her long-running cabaret hit, *The Dozen Divas Show*.

The production is directed by Jean Tait, whose Off-Broadway credits include *The Pearly Gates*, *Hijab at First Sight*, *The Proceedings*, and *It Gets Better*.
