description: "Two rival TV chefs are forced to co-host a cooking show, stirring up a recipe for hilarious disaster."
---
Isobel and Dolly, two diva TV chefs with a bitter history, find themselves unwillingly paired on a new television show. As the spatulas fly and the insults roll, they must learn to share the spotlight while their off-screen drama threatens to boil over. It's a chaotic concoction of laughs, rivalry, and maybe, just maybe, a dash of friendship.
