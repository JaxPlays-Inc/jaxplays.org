In *Other Desert Cities*, Brooke Wyeth returns home after a six-year absence to celebrate Christmas with her parents, brother, and aunt. But the festive mood turns tense when she reveals plans to publish a memoir that would expose her family's dark secrets, including her late brother's involvement in a tragic event. As everyone tries to navigate the emotional minefield, loyalties are tested and painful truths come to light.
