Determined to return home, she sets off on the Yellow Brick Road toward the Emerald City to seek help from the mysterious Wizard. Along the way, Dorothy befriends a Scarecrow, a Tin Man and a Cowardly Lion, who all seek the Wizard's help for their own desires. Facing witches and many other challenges, the group learns about courage, love, wisdom, and the power of friendship. This beloved musical enchants audiences with its iconic music, including 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow,' and its timeless message of discovery and self-realization.
