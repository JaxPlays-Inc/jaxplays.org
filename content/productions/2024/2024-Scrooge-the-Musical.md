 Charles Dickens first published his novel, *A Christmas Carol*, in 1843. Since that time, numerous renditions of the story have been used to teach some wonderful life lessons. *Scrooge: The Musical* recounts the story of an elderly miser, who is visited in the middle of the night by the ghost of his former business partner. He is assisted by three additional spirits who warn Scrooge that he must change from his miserable ways or suffer in an eternity of despair.  After their visits, Scrooge chooses to make the needed alterations to his way of life.

This is the fourth year that our Nassau County Tax Collector John M. Drew is directing the show at Amelia Musical Playhouse (AMP) and the 7th year that AMP is sharing this performance with the community. More than 50 people are sharing their talents this year to make this production an outstanding success.
