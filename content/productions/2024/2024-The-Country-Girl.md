*The Country Girl* by Clifford Odets is a gripping drama that explores the complexities of marriage, redemption and the harsh realities of show business. The story centers around Frank Elgin, a once-prominent actor whose career has plummeted due to his alcoholism. As he attempts to revive his faltering career with the help of a determined director, his long-suffering wife, Georgie, remains his strongest supporter, despite the toll his failures have taken on their marriage. This intense and emotionally charged play examines the sacrifices made in the name of love and the resilience needed to overcome personal demons.
