 Trapped in a loveless engagement to a nearby prince, Aelia turns toward the ocean for answers. There, she encounters Selena by the shore, leaving her hopelessly questioning her true desires. Whether this be a passionate fling, a romantic escape, or something deeper, Aelia is both terrified and thrilled to find out. How will she respond to rapturing temptation? Will she be able to fend off her annoying fianc√©, Antonius, scheming handmaiden, Cordelia, and shrill mother, The Queen? And will Selena, in the end, be able to fend off her own, all-encompassing hunger?
