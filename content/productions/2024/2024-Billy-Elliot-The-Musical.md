In a small English mining town during the 1984 miners' strike, Billy Elliot discovers a passion for ballet. While his father and brother take to the picket lines, Billy secretly trains to be a dancer, finding solace and hope in a world falling apart. Facing prejudices and adversity, Billy fights for the chance to live his dream, transform his life, and bring his community together through the power of dance.
