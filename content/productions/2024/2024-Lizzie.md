---
In the heat of late summer 1892, Andrew Borden and his wife were found murdered in their house. The main suspect in the murders was Andrew’s youngest daughter from a previous marriage, Lizzie Borden. Using a searing rock score, and based on the historical record, *Lizzie* explores the heady and heated days leading up to the murder and Lizzie’s controversial acquittal of all charges and the creation of a new American myth.

**Trigger Warnings:** *Lizzie* contains themes of childhood sexual abuse and violence and may not be appropriate for all audiences. Discretion is advised. Strobe and fog special fx are used during the performance.
