Eclipsed by the famed opera house and a tormented past, the Phantom finds his muse in the beautiful soprano Christine. As he coaches her to stardom, a complex love triangle unfolds, charged with obsession and suspense. This is not your grandmother's Phantom; it's a musically rich, emotionally charged retelling that delves deep into the minds of its characters.
