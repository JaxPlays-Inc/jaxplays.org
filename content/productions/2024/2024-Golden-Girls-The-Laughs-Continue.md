*Golden Girls: The Laughs Continue* catapults us into 2024 where Sophia finds herself out on bail after a daring run-in with the DEA for operating a retiree drug ring. Meanwhile, Blanche and Rose dive into the tech scene with CreakN, a burgeoning sex app for seniors. Dorothy, ever the glue holding the group together, grapples with her new relationship dynamics with a much younger, libidinous beau. This wild tour through their latest escapades delivers the same heartfelt hilarity with an audacious twist, showcasing the enduring camaraderie and wit of these iconic ladies. Rated for adult audiences, this continuation brings a bold, contemporary edge to the timeless charm of the Golden Girls.
