Description: "Piracy meets absurdity in this rollicking Gilbert and Sullivan classic. A young pirate-in-training, Frederic, grapples with duty and love as he navigates treacherous waters filled with whimsical characters."
---
When Frederic turns 21, his pirate apprenticeship is up and he's ready to embrace the virtues of a law-abiding life. However, his sense of duty gets hilariously convoluted when he falls in love with Mabel, the daughter of a Major-General. Misunderstandings, leap-year loopholes, and tongue-twisting lyrics ensue as Frederic struggles between his loyalty to his pirate crew and the call of true love.
