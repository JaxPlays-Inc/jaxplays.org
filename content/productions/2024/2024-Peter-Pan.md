Peter takes Wendy, John, and Michael Darling on an extraordinary journey across the stars to a land of mermaids, pirates, and fairies. Confronting the dastardly Captain Hook and bonding with the Lost Boys, the children experience a series of thrilling escapades. Through songs like 'Iâ€™m Flying' and 'Never Never Land,' this beloved musical explores themes of eternal childhood, the bonds of friendship, and the spirit of adventure that dwells within everyone.
