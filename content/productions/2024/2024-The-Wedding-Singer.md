Description: "Step back into the neon-soaked '80s with The Wedding Singer, where love songs, heartbreak, and hairdos collide in this upbeat musical comedy."
---
Robbie Hart, New Jersey's favorite wedding singer, is the life of the party until his own fianc√©e leaves him at the altar. Heartbroken and cynical, he begins to sabotage weddings with his morose performances. That is until he meets Julia, a sweet waitress who wins his heart. But Julia is set to marry a Wall Street shark, and Robbie must pull off the performance of a decade to win her love. Packed with infectious tunes, big laughs, and even bigger hair, The Wedding Singer is a nostalgic trip to the '80s with a romantic twist.
