Description: "Benji, a young veteran, grapples with adapting to civilian life and mending relationships in his hometown, where the past is inescapable."
---
When Benji's father dies, he temporarily moves in with his childhood friend Sam. Wounded in the war, Benji struggles to process his time in the service and the emotional scars brought on by childhood trauma.

The new living arrangement brings past events to the surface. Benji must contend with who he is and wants to becomeâ€”a thought-provoking and heartbreaking play about identity, masculinity, love, and acceptance.
