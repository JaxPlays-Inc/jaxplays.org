*Little Shop of Horrors* centers on Seymour, a down-on-his-luck florist working in a skid row flower shop. His discovery of a strange plant, which he names Audrey II after his coworker crush, turns his life upside down. The plant, which speaks and sings, demands to be fed human blood, growing larger and more manipulative with each feeding. As Seymour struggles to satisfy Audrey II's growing appetites, he must decide how much he's willing to sacrifice for love, success and his own survival. Set to a rock and roll, doo-wop score, this cult classic musical blends humor, horror and a poignant look at human desires and weaknesses.
