*Mac Beth* by Erica Schmidt reimagines Shakespeare's *Macbeth* with a cast of seven young women who meet after school to recreate the tale of ambition and madness. Set in an abandoned urban lot, these students don costumes and wield makeshift props to dive into the roles of Macbeth, Lady Macbeth and other pivotal characters. As the play progresses, the lines between acting and reality blur, pulling the girls into a spiraling vortex of power and paranoia. Schmidt’s adaptation explores themes of youth, power, and corruption, echoing the timeless relevance of Shakespeare’s work in a contemporary setting.
