It's the final year of high school for Corey Palmer, and he's ready to make it unforgettable. Set against a backdrop of iconic '80s hits, this musical romp follows Corey and his friends as they navigate the highs and lows of adolescence. From first loves to heartbreaks, and from bullies to besties, it's a journey filled with legwarmers, Rubik's Cubes, and the kind of melodrama that can only exist in the 1980s. So grab your Walkman and get ready to rewind to a time when hair was big, and the music was even bigger.
