*Into The Breeches!* unfolds in 1942, with America's men off fighting in World War II. As the local theater's director is also away at war, his determined wife decides to press on with the season's scheduled Shakespeare production. With a script, a cause and an enthusiastic, albeit inexperienced, all-female cast, they embark on a comedic and inspiring journey to bring the Bard's histories to life.
