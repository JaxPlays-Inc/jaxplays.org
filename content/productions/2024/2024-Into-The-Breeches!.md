Description: "*Into the Breeches* is a heartwarming comedy set in a theatre in 1942. It examines the changing life on the home front during WWII with its play-within-a-play storyline."
---
 It’s 1942, and the leading men of the Oberon Play House are fighting overseas. At home, a band of passionate performers, united in desire (if not actual theater experience), rally together with their battle cry of “The Show Must Go On!” They are determined to produce the Oberon’s season opener with an ambitious all-female Shakespearean production. Will their production be a victory for the home front or an epic failure? A delightful and moving story about what happens when we all join together.

 **NOTE** Out of a strong sense of caution for Hurricane Milton, ACT has decided to cancel tonight's Wednesday preview along with our opening show on Thursday night. Therefore, we will officially open our 44th season with "Into the Breeches!" on Friday, October 11th at 7:30pm. We will be contacting ticket holders to reschedule their Thursday tickets.
