Doomed to a life of servitude under her wicked stepmother and stepsisters, Cinderella's fortunes change when her Fairy Godmother appears. With a wave of a wand, she's off to the royal ball. But when the clock strikes midnight, the magic ends, leaving behind only a glass slipper and the search for true love.
