Description: "Arranged marriages, mistaken identities, and pirate legends collide in the whimsical world of *El Phantismo*."
---
Sierra, a young woman trapped in an arranged marriage, conspires with her friends to meet her would-be groom, Santiago. Santiago, similarly plotting, decides to woo Sierra while disguised as El Phantismo, a legendary pirate from local folklore. But love is only the tip of the icebergâ€”between a conniving mayor, a pirate hunter, fake padres, and a real pirate masquerading as a priest, the town spirals into hilarious chaos. Multiple El Phantismos emerge, romances bloom, and villains are unmasked, culminating in an uproarious quest for the real padre and a dash of true love.
