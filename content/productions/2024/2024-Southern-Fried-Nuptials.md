The sequel to 'Southern Fried Funeral,' this play takes us back to the Frye family as they prepare for another life-changing event: the wedding of daughter Harlene. Amidst a flurry of last-minute preparations, family squabbles, and bridal party chaos, the Fryes must navigate through a series of comical hurdles to get Harlene down the aisle. With a blend of Southern charm and witty humor, 'Southern Fried Nuptials' serves up a delightful comedy that's as warm and comforting as sweet tea on a hot summer day.
