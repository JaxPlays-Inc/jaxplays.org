In the tumultuous summer of 1775, Emily Cartridge takes a daring step, offering her skills as a spy to General Carter. As she navigates the complexities and dangers of life in the Continental Army, she grapples with moral quandaries and looming threats that could spell doom for her and her friends. 

Colonel William Shepard, valorous and selfless, has a bounty on his head and a heart devoted to his comrades. As the American Revolution rages on, both Emily and William must confront their own vulnerabilities. Is William's compassionate heart his greatest strength or a fatal flaw? 

Amidst the chaos of war and the fragility of alliances, "Unmasked" delves into the ethical battlegrounds of the human spirit, where loyalties are tested and courage is measured not by the sword, but by the soul.
