Description: "Step into the powerful world of *Cadillac Crew*, where the unsung heroes of the Civil Rights Movement take center stage, revealing the struggles and triumphs of four women determined to change the world."
---
Set against the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement, *Cadillac Crew* follows four African American women working in a Virginia civil rights office. As they prepare for a groundbreaking speech by Rosa Parks, they grapple with their own desires, dreams, and the harsh realities of a segregated America. Through compelling dialogue and poignant storytelling, the play sheds light on the vital yet often overlooked contributions of women in the fight for equality. *Cadillac Crew* is a stirring tribute to resilience, sisterhood, and the relentless pursuit of justice."
