Description: "When blind date newbie Aaron meets serial dater Casey, a casual drink turns into a hilarious high-stakes dinner."
---
Aaron is a nice guy who's new to blind dates, and Casey is a cynic who's been on far too many. Their casual drink quickly escalates into a high-stakes dinner filled with potential romance and a side of awkwardness. The two navigate through exes, insecurities, and differing interests, all while singing their way through the evening. Will this first date be a hit or a total disaster?
