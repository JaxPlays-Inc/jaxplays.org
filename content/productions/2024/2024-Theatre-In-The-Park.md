Description: 
---
Not your typical Bard in the Park! It’s part Shakespeare sampler and part interactive storytelling. Shining light on scenes from Shakespeare’s well-known plays and some hidden gems, the evening will somehow seamlessly (or maybe not so seamlessly) flow into an interactive experience where the audience can be spectators or participants (their choice).

Lumen Repertory Theatre is Northeast Florida’s definitive theatre experience, filling empty spaces with possibilities through bold, professional productions.

The event is free and open to the public. Some chairs will be available, however, the audience is encouraged to bring their own folding chairs and blankets. Food trucks will be set up on both nights.
