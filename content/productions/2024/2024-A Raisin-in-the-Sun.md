The Younger family, living in a cramped Chicago apartment, dreams of a better life when they receive a $10,000 insurance check. Each family member has their own vision of the future, from buying a house to attending medical school or investing in a liquor store. Their aspirations and the harsh realities of their circumstances collide, forcing them to unite and fight for their dreams in a world that seems set against them. *A Raisin in the Sun* is a powerful examination of racial discrimination, poverty and the enduring power of dreams.
