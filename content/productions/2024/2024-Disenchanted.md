Say goodbye to the fairytale damsel in distress. The princesses in *Disenchanted!* have had enough of waiting for their Prince Charming. In this hilarious musical revue, Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and more swap their glass slippers for stilettos and get real about love, life, and what it means to be a modern woman. Perfect for anyone who's ever rolled their eyes at a perfect fairytale ending.

On [January 31, ABET - All Beaches Experimental Theatre announced on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ABETtheatre/posts/pfbid02SuGHW4Bps2tJ3ZfZ6eLGZQwrhgsU1w8KzoXFXe625Ds8rVnS22u2AkNz5zEwovJ9l) an extension of their highly popular show, *Disenchanted!*, due to overwhelming demand. Originally staged at [John McManus Mainstage Theatre](/venues/john-mcmanus-mainstage-theatre/) at [Players by the Sea](/theatres/players-by-the-sea/), the production sold out rapidly, prompting additional performances at the [Matuza Mainstage](/venues/matuza-mainstage/) at the [Limelight Theatre](/theatres/limelight-theatre/) in St. Augustine. The special run spans from March 8 through March 10, offering three exclusive shows.
