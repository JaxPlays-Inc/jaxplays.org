Susy Hendrix may be blind, but when a band of criminals invades her space in search of a contraband-stuffed doll, they soon realize they're the ones in the dark. Outwitting her antagonists using wit and resourcefulness, Susy turns a night of fear into a cunning game. Get ready to recalibrate your definition of suspense as Susy turns the tables, making the night her own labyrinth of twists.
