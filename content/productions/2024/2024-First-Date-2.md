 Amelia Community Theatre invites you to the romantic musical comedy *First Date*. Audiences will have the fun of watching a first date/blind date unfold in real time, as the actors sing, “Here’s hoping that this next first date will be my last.”

Director Susan Dodge says, “This is a musical for everyone. It has a mighty cast, catchy tunes and so much comedy. Whether you’re single, coupled up, or somewhere in-between, you’re bound to see yourself (or your embarrassing cousin) in these characters.”

Tickets are $30 for adults and $15 for students, available through the box office at (904) 261-6749 and through the website, [AmeliaCommunityTheatre.org](https://www.ameliacommunitytheatre.org/). Box office hours are from 11 a.m. – 1 p.m. on Wednesdays through Fridays and 90 minutes before curtain on show dates. *First Date* has a suggested PG-13 rating for adult themes and language.
