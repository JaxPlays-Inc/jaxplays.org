From pilot to doctor to lawyer, Frank Abagnale Jr. dons multiple disguises and executes some of the most outrageous cons ever known to the FBI, which is hot on his trail. As Agent Carl Hanratty closes in, Frank must outmaneuver the law and confront the consequences of his deceptions. With a swinging '60s score and a story that captures the essence of adventure, *Catch Me If You Can* is a riveting, big-hearted tale that examines the line between fact and fiction, and the power of redemption.
