Sherri Rosen-Mason is head of admissions at a New England prep school, committed to increasing the school's diversity. But her progressive values are put to the test when her son is deferred from his dream Ivy League school, while his best friend, who is biracial, is admitted. 'Admissions' unfolds as a provocative and often uncomfortable conversation about race, privilege and the lengths we go to protect our own.
