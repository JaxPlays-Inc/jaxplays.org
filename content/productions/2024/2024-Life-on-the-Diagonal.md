*Life on the Diagonal* is a vibrant one-woman play written and performed by Barbara Colaciello, where she reflects on her dynamic journey from a New York upbringing to her artistic endeavors in Northeast Florida. Through monologues infused with original music and poetry, Barbara navigates the landscapes of her past and present, revealing the humor, sexuality and occasional madness of her life. The performance is a candid look into her experiences, marked by an intense vocabulary of self-definition and a quest to escape the "land of should." *Life on the Diagonal* offers an intense yet humorous examination of life’s nonlinear path.

“Barbara Colaciello's *Life on the Diagonal* was wonderful. Inspired by her courage, intensity, and humor. Brava!” - Hope McMath

“...Beautiful, brilliant, and funny,” - Al Letson

"The songs were original, fierce, connective and catchy. Combined with David's beatbox mastery you would think there was a full band on stage! The show is full of wisdom, my only regret was not bringing a pen and paper to write down the gems Babs graciously shares." - Ari Gaskin
