*Picasso at the Lapin Agile* is a whimsical joyride that catapults you into a Parisian café in 1904. Here, two of history’s most transformative figures, Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso, are on the brink of monumental discoveries. As intellectual sparks fly and egos clash, they debate the grand concepts of art, science, and the nature of genius. But when a charismatic singer from a future era mysteriously appears, the café's patrons are swept into an uproarious whirlpool of wit and wonder. Written by Steve Martin, this absurdist comedy is a delightful concoction of historical what-ifs and whimsical speculations that offers a lighthearted look at the profound and the absurd.
