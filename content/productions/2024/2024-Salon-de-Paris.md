In the highbrow setting of Salon de Paris, a sanctuary for an older and sophisticated clientele, worlds collide as Mr. Rene, the proprietor, takes a chance on Mikey Dorsey, a young, pierced, and rebellious parolee in need of a job. The unlikely pairing not only disrupts the salon's refined atmosphere but also shakes up its quirky, set-in-their-ways staff. As tensions and humor unfold, both sides are forced to adapt, finding that the most unexpected relationships often offer the most surprising rewards.
