---
*Barefoot in the Park* follows the adventures and misadventures of Corie and Paul Bratter, freshly married and settling into their first apartment in New York City. The play humorously showcases their contrasting personalitiesâ€”Corie's free-spirited approach to life clashes with Paul's straight-laced nature. As they navigate the challenges of their cramped living space, eccentric neighbors, and their own marital quirks, the couple learns that love often means embracing each other's differences and finding joy in the unexpected.
