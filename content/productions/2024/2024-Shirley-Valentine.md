Shirley, a Liverpool housewife stuck in a cooking-cleaning rut, starts talking to her kitchen wall out of sheer loneliness. Spurred by a friend's gift of a trip to Greece, she leaves her humdrum life and jet-sets to the Greek Islands. Through sun, sand, and self-discovery, Shirley learns to appreciate her own worth, reminding us all that it's never too late to bloom.
