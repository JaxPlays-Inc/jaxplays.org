Godder Than A Muthafucka is a poetic exchange between the black woman and the black man inspired by the systematic destruction of the black family unit and the demonization of its matriarch. This production features the poetry and music of award-winning author Ebony Payne-English alongside legendary spoken word artist and battle rapper, Moses West. These two hometown powerhouses examine and interpret the controversial conversation surrounding patriarchy as it relates to religion, domestic exchange, and politics. Provocative performance art paired with choreography from artistic director, Rochelle Underdue, and vibes by Hip & Hookah's founder, Mas Appeal, guarantees a once in a lifetime experience of excellence. — [Godder Than A Muthafucka Tickets, Sun, Feb 23, 2020 at 7:00 PM - Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/godder-than-a-muthafucka-tickets-89589134513)
