"The Food of Love" is a site-specific, queer, gourmand take on Cyrano de Bergerac's tale of unrequited love in which two suitors woo a beloved in tandem. Whereas Edmond Rostand's insecure braggart Cyrano woos Roxanne with eloquent words whispered through the handsome Christian, our modern "Cyrano" Alex allows Chris to pass off a five-star, five-course as his own in order to woo Roxy. Before the true identity of the chef is revealed, the audience will literally "have what she's having" as audience members will dine on a delicious, story-driven menu as Roxy does." — [OUR NEXT EVENT: THE FOOD OF LOVE at MOCA Jacksonville](http://www.phaseeight.org/2020-season.html)
