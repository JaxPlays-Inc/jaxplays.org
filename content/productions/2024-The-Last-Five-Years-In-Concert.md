*The Last Five Years - In Concert* presents a unique rendition of Jason Robert Brown's acclaimed musical, stripped down to its emotional core through a concert format. This narrative unfolds through alternating perspectives of Jamie and Cathy, a couple whose story is told from end to beginning by her, and from beginning to end by him. This concert setting intensifies the poignant and heartfelt music that chronicles their love, dreams, and the challenges that ultimately lead to their separation. With minimal staging, the focus is solely on the powerful lyrics and melodies that resonate with the complexities of modern love and ambition.
