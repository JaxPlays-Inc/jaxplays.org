"Evolution and emotion collide in this thought-provoking play about science, family, and survival of the fittest. On the eve of a prestigious conference Rachel, a young, up-and-coming evolutionary biologist with a radical new hypothesis challenges the work and life choices of an established professor, who is revealed to be her birth mother. This intimate and keenly perceptive play examines the development and progression of scientific theory, along with the difficult choices faced by women of every generation." â€” [Actors Collective](http://www.actorscollective.com/the-secret-of-life/)
