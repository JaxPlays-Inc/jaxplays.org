“In this two-man musical spoof, a pair of aspiring playwrights perform a backers’ audition for their new project - a big, splashy musical about printing press inventor Johannes Gutenberg. With an unending supply of enthusiasm, Bud and Doug sing all the songs and play all of the roles themselves, wearing hats with the characters' names on them and frequently switching said hats to indicate different characters.” — [Gutenberg! The Musical! - The 5 & Dime](https://www.the5anddime.org/gutenberg-the-musical)
