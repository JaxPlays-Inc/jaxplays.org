"A Doll's House, Part 2" is a play written by Lucas Hnath and is a continuation of the classic play "A Doll's House" by Henrik Ibsen. The play takes place 15 years after the events of the original play and follows the character of Nora, who has returned to her former home seeking a divorce from her husband, Torvald. Nora, who had famously left her husband and children at the end of the first play, is now a successful writer but finds herself confronted with the consequences of her past actions. As she reconnects with her former family, tensions arise and secrets are revealed, leading to a thought-provoking exploration of marriage, gender roles, and the nature of freedom.
