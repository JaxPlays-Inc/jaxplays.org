Set in the tumultuous 1960s, *Moon Children* explores the lives of a group of college roommates as they navigate love, politics, and identity. Michael Weller's compelling script offers a vivid portrayal of young people teetering on the brink of adulthood, grappling with a world that seems as chaotic as their hearts.

"In April of 2015, FSCJ Dramaworks presented Moonchildren, a dramatic comedy by Michael Weller. Originally premiering under the title Cancer in 1971 at London’s Royal Court Theatre, Moonchildren received its American premiere under its current title in Washington, DC a few months later before debuting on Broadway in 1972.

The play itself is about learning, and tests the involvement of a seemingly typical bunch of semi-communal 1965 kids in education, political action, and their own identities over the course of their last year in college. Set during the midst of the civil rights movement and at the forefront of the full galvanization of the anti-Vietnam war protests and the hippie counter-culture of Woodstock, the play takes place in a period still years away from full recognition of women’s rights and gay rights.

Weller’s unique theatrical style weaves together strands from Anton Chekhov, vaudeville, and Samuel Beckett. There is no conventional “plot”. Events occur. Relationships are experienced. Characters evolve. Graduation comes with the shock of eviction from a golden age, which they had treated as temporary and hostile. Maturity arrives with the sadness of wisdom. They have all come through academically. Careers are open to them. But knowledge has grown frightening, and the future more so. Fighting against loneliness may be their ultimate protest.

Be advised this play contains language and content some may find objectionable, and may not be suitable for audiences under 17."  [ — Moon Children - FSCJ Dramaworks](http://fscj.digital.flvc.org/islandora/search/?type=edismax&collection=fscj%3Amoonchildren)
