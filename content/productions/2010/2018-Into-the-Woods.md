Step *Into the Woods* where Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, and Jack (of beanstalk fame) get more than they bargained for. With Sondheim's ingenious score, the story explores the consequences of the characters' wishes and quests. Just when you think 'happily ever after' is within reach, think again. This musical cautions to be careful what you wish forâ€”you might just get it.
