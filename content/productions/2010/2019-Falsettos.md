"After their wildly successful production of *A New Brain* during their inaugural season downtown, The 5 & Dime continues to explore the works of James Lapine & William Finn with their groundbreaking, Tony Award-winning musical *Falsettos*. This whirlwind story revolves around the life of a charming, intelligent, neurotic gay man named Marvin, his wife, his lover, his about-to-be-Bar-Mitzvahed son, his psychiatrist… and the lesbians next door. Set in New York before and during the AIDS crisis of the early 80’s, *Falsettos* proves with equal doses of comedy and heart that family - as non-traditional as it may be – always comes first. It’s a hilarious and achingly poignant look at the infinite possibilities that make up a modern family… and a beautiful reminder that love can tell a million stories." — [FALSETTOS - The 5 & Dime](https://www.the5anddime.org/falsettos)
