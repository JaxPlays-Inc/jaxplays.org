Playwright Olympe de Gouges, Haitian spy Marianne Angelle, assassin Charlotte Corday, and former queen Marie Antoinette hang out, plot, and bond, all while pushing back against the hyper-violent hypocritical male-dominated rhetoric of the times. However will modern audiences relate?

 Extremism and legacy, art and activism, feminism and terrorism, individualism and sisterhood, all are examined in this smart, dream-infused comedy performed reader’s theatre style.
