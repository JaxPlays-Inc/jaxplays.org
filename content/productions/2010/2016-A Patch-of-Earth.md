*A Patch of Earth* unveils the haunting journey of 'the crybaby,' a 25-year-old Bosnian Croat who serves in three armies without killing, until a fateful afternoon in a cornfield near Srebrenica. Faced with a 'shoot or be shot' ultimatum, he makes a tragic decision to save his family. Haunted by the ghosts of those he killed, he eventually risks everything by confessing his role in the Srebrenica massacre, hoping to find redemption but tearing his own life apart.
