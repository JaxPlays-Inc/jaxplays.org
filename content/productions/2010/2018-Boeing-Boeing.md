Description: "Parisian lothario Bernard juggles three fiancées, all air hostesses on different schedules, until an upgraded Boeing changes everything."
---
Bernard's perfect life with his three fiancées—a German, an Italian, and an American air hostess—hits turbulence when faster Boeing jets bring them to Paris simultaneously. This classic farce takes off as Bernard, with the help of his bewildered friend Robert and his long-suffering housekeeper Berthe, tries to prevent his carefully separated worlds from crashing down. Packed with door slams, mistaken identities, and comedic timing, 'Boeing Boeing' is a high-flying escapade into the complexities of love and lies.
