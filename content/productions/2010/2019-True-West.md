Description: Sons of a desert-dwelling alcoholic and suburban wanderer have chosen extremely different lives. Their sibling rivalry violently erupts as they compete for the attention of a Hollywood Producer, each trying to sell him a story for a new motion picture. Unsettling and intense, this American Classic tackles identity, family and self-doubt.
