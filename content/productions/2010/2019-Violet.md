*Violet* is a Tony-nominated musical that tells the story of a young woman named Violet Karl who, as a teenager, was scarred in a farm accident. Set in the 1960s, Violet embarks on a journey by bus from her home in North Carolina to Tulsa, Oklahoma, in search of a miraculous healing from a televangelist. Along the way, she meets two young soldiers who help her to confront her past and find true beauty in herself. With a lively bluegrass and gospel score and a poignant and uplifting story about self-acceptance, *Violet* is a touching and powerful musical that explores the complexities of identity, forgiveness, and human connection.
