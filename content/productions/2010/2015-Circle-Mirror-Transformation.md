*Circle Mirror Transformation* is a captivating ensemble piece that turns a seemingly mundane community drama class into a riveting exploration of human vulnerability and connection. Set in a small Vermont town, the play uses the backdrop of theater games to peel back the layers of its characters, each a puzzle unto themselves. As the weeks unfold, laughter and awkward silences give way to startling confessions and transformative moments. It's a raw, often humorous, and deeply empathetic look at the complexities of human emotion, making the audience question what it truly means to "act" and to "be."
