Inspired by a true story, Anna Ziegler’s 'Boy' explores the tricky terrain of finding love amidst the confusion of sexual identity, and the inextricable bond between a doctor and patient. In the 1960s, a well-intentioned doctor convinces the parents of a male infant to raise their son as a girl after a terrible accident. Two decades later, the repercussions of that choice continue to unfold." — [BOY - The 5 &amp; Dime](https://www.the5anddime.org/boy)
