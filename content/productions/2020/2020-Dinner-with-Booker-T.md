Presented in dinner-theater style with a meal prepared by chef DeJuan Roy, Executive Chef for the Alhambra Dinner Theatre, fourteen characters tell the life story of Booker T. Washington. Much of the script is based on speeches, letters and historic documents. The one-man show is based on Stage Aurora’s original play ‘The Dinner’ which debuted in Manhattan. — [Stage Aurora presents Dinner with Booker T. - IwantaBuzz](https://iwantabuzz.com/arts/arts-in-the-know/stage-aurora-presents-dinner-with-booker-t/)
