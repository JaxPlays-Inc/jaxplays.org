"Broadway’s greatest musical farce takes us back to Ancient Rome for a unique and unforgettable production. Pseudolus, a devious slave, makes a deal to win his freedom by playing matchmaker for his lovesick master, Hero. Rife with pompous generals, domineering parents, and wiley courtesans, this hilarious Tony-winning musical is a non-stop laugh-fest with “something for everyone!" — [A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM - Players by the Sea](https://www.playersbythesea.org/forum)

"Expertly directed by Michael Lipp," this production of Forum is "light, fast-paced, witty and irreverent." — [A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum - IwantaBuzz](https://iwantabuzz.com/arts/arts-in-the-know/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-forum-3/)
