Her name is Sara Beth Sohn. Not Elizabeth—Beth. Sohn, after her father. She was so christened. She is innocent, and she will leave it to the audience to speak for her.

She is passionate about performing and loves exploring the complexities of humanity through storytelling. Previously, she has been seen in [[production:2022 Ruthless]] as Eve at Players By The Sea, in the ensemble of *Sweeney Todd*, and as a millworker in *Working* at ABET.

Sara is also actively involved in local community organizations. Stay connected with her on Instagram: [@drsarasohn](https://www.instagram.com/drsarasohn)
