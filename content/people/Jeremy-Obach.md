Jeremy is thrilled to return to the musical theatre stage for the first time since high school, reigniting a passion that has been simmering for years. Prior to [[production:2024 Tarzan|*Tarzan*]], Jeremy dedicated five years to serving in the Navy, a journey that broadened his horizons and deepened his appreciation for teamwork and discipline. Now, as he steps back into the spotlight, Jeremy brings a wealth of life experience and a renewed enthusiasm for the art of storytelling.
