Kaila Schippani grew up in Oxford, Connecticut and started dancing at the young age of 2. She received her training in ballet, jazz, and tap while also competing at the state and national level with her New England dance teams before moving to St. Augustine, FL in 2011.

Kaila received two degrees from Keene State College in Education and Wellness and Movement (a collaboration of Health Science and Dance).  These helped her obtain her current positions as the full-time dance director with St. Johnâ€™s County Center for the Arts (SJCCA) at St. Augustine High School and also as an instructor at Mia Bella Academy of Dance.
 
In these positions, Kaila has coached a nationally-ranked dance team and also has had the opportunity to choreograph many SJCCA musicals including; Urinetown (2016), Legally Blonde (2017), Mamma Mia! (2018), Mary Poppins (2019), Bright Star (2020), Pippin (2021), Cinderella (2022), and Newsies (2023).
