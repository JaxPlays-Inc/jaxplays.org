A retired teacher, engineer, and business owner, Bob discovered theater after retiring in 2019 and has since performed in more than 40 productions across Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia. Favorite roles include Grandpa Joe (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), J.B. Biggley (How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying), Nostradamus (Something Rotten), Moonface Martin (Anything Goes), Herr Schultz (Cabaret), Professor Bhaer (Little Women), Frollo (The Hunchback of Notre Dame), Mr. Maraczek (She Loves Me), Cord Elam (Oklahoma!), and yesâ€”even the Monster in Young Frankenstein.

He recently expanded into film with a role as a Greek priest in Greek Mothers Never Die. Offstage, Bob can often be found biking around Amelia Island, singing show tunes and running lines (with apologies to startled pedestrians).
