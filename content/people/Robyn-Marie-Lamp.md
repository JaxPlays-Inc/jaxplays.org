Robyn Marie Lamp is a powerful Florida-based soprano whose operatic and concert career is flourishing. “Soprano star quality,” “radiant pianissimos,” and “silvery soprano timbre,” are just some of the ways critics describe her. Her 2023-24 season will include the role of Donna Anna in Mozart's *Don Giovanni* with both Opera Tampa and Winter Opera St. Louis, as well as soloist in *Considering Matthew Shepard* with Master Chorale of South Florida. Highlights of 2022-23 included the role of Mimì in Puccini’s *La bohème* with Opera in Williamsburg, Julia Child in Hoiby’s *Bon Appétit!* with First Coast Opera, and soprano soloist in Verdi’s *Requiem* with the Masterworks Chorus at Carnegie Hall. She also was the soprano soloist in Handel’s *Messiah* with Palm Beach Symphony, an ensemble member of the Grammy-nominated vocal ensemble Seraphic Fire, and a featured soloist in galas for Opera Orlando, Opera Tampa and Gulfshore Opera. 

Coming out of the COVID pandemic shutdown, 2021-22 highlights included the title role in Puccini’s *Tosca* with Gulfshore Opera, soprano soloist in Beethoven’s *Egmont Op. 84* with Orchestra Miami and soprano soloist in Mozart’s *Requiem* with both Palm Beach Symphony and Master Chorale of South Florida. She also won first place in the D’Angelo Young Artist Vocal Competition at Opera Tampa that season. 

Lamp co-founded [[theatre:Amelia Island Opera]] in 2021, a company she formed to serve her arts-hungry North Florida community; she is also company manager for IlluminArts, a Miami-based nonprofit that presents world-class performances of classical music to Miami’s vibrant arts audiences.
