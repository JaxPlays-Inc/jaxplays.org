Ken’s directorial journey included a wide array of productions, from *Twelfth Night* to *James and the Giant Peach*, showcasing his ability to bridge classic and contemporary works with finesse. He also had the privilege of directing the Edward Albee play *The Lady from Dubuque* with Albee himself in attendance, highlighting his influence and respect within the theatrical world.

Before his tenure at FSCJ, Ken worked extensively in various roles in the theater scene, including lighting designer, master electrician and stage manager, bringing a holistic approach to his directorial projects. His productions often ventured into bold and complex territories, such as the newly discovered Mark Twain play *Is He Dead?* and his ambitious staging of *Tales from Hollywood* at Memphis State University.

He nurtured aspiring actors and technicians through thoughtful mentorship and innovative teaching methods, ensuring that each student not only honed their craft but also appreciated the artistic integrity of the theatrical arts. His efforts culminated in transformative productions that left indelible marks on audiences and participants alike.

Ken’s legacy extends beyond the stage through his collaborations, most notably with playwrights and actors who found in him a creative anchor and a visionary director. His final production, *The Mad Atlas of Virginia King*, symbolized his enduring passion for storytelling and his dedication to the art form he loved.
