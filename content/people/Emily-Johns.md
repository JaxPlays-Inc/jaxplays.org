Emily is a Jacksonville native who has a passion for the arts, especially theater and musical theater. Emily has been involved in the world of theater since a young child, and continued her passion throughout high school and college! She took a hiatus from the arts world to complete the rigorous journey through veterinary school. Now, she is a small animal veterinarian practicing in her hometown, giving back to the community animals which she loves so much. But she has dived back into the local community theater and has never looked back!
