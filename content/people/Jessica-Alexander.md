Jessica grew up in New York, & from a very young age she loved to sing, dance, act, & perform. She filled her school years with as many musicals & performing opportunities as possible.

At the age of 18, Jessica flew to the sunny state of Florida to explore & travel, while studying musical theatre at Jacksonville University. It was here that she met her husband, & they now have three beautiful children together.
