Gloria Pepe has been an indispensable part of the Jacksonville theatre community for over three decades. Beginning her journey in March 1985 shortly after relocating from Indiana, Gloria first lent her talents to set construction and prop management at [Theatre Jacksonville](/theatres/theatre-jacksonville). As technology evolved, so did Gloria's skillset; she added light board operator to her repertoire.

From operating manual boards that required quick thinking and precise execution, to mastering the intricacies of computerized systems, Gloria became an expert in lighting design and execution. Over the years, she collaborated with multiple tech directors, gaining invaluable insights that enriched her expertise in both lighting and set construction.

After three fulfilling decades at Theatre Jax, Gloria decided it was time for a new chapter. She may no longer be a fixture at what she considers the top community theatre in Northeast Florida, but her influence continues to cast a warm glow over the Northeast Florida theatre scene.
