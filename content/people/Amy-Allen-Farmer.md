Whether she’s training actors, working with cadavers, creating gory special effects makeup, or playing villains, crazy people or opium den madams on stage, Amy always finds a way to overbook herself and survive on sarcasm and caffeine for extended periods of time. Some of her favorite roles include The Witch in Into the Woods (PBTS), Joanne in Company, (5 & Dime), Little Edie in Grey Gardens (Theatre Jax), Trenna in Ring of Fire (Limelight Theatre), and various and sundry Gilbert & Sullivan operetta roles across the Boston area during her much younger days (Mad Margaret/Ruddigore, Phoebe/Yeoman of the Guard, Tessa/Gondoliers, Ruth/Pirates of Penzance). Amy would like to thank Rick, Charlotte, and Audrey for surviving on leftovers and takeout for the last 3 months while I pursue this crazy hobby. Amy would also like to thank her mom, brothers and best friend Julie for their unwavering support and love. I miss you Pops, you’ll always be my #1 fan!
