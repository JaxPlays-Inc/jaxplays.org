Alberto Carlos Peart discovered his passion for acting and dance at the age of 15, launching a career defined by versatility, creativity, and a commitment to powerful storytelling. Recognized early for his talent, he was awarded Best Male Actor by the Western Massachusetts Theater Association for his performance as King Claudius in Hamlet with Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, MA.

His talents extend beyond acting—his choreography in the Off-Broadway production of *The City That Cried Wolf* earned him a "...striking" review from The New York Times in 2002. From 2003 to 2007, he performed with the internationally acclaimed ensemble Serious Play! while also instructing and competing in ballroom dance.

In 2008, Alberto Carlos appeared as a day player in the ABC Family series *Greek* and performed in numerous stage productions, including the highly reviewed play *Sex, Relationships, and Sometimes...Love*. His artistic journey took him to Madrid, Spain, in 2010, where he founded JYA I AM Productions, producing independent film projects while continuing to perform with Real Live Theatre in Massachusetts.

Alberto Carlos is also a dedicated playwright and director. In 2018, he began production on his original play, *I, Hope*, a thought-provoking exploration of the inhumane treatment of persons with disabilities throughout history and into the present day. His work is driven by a passion for truth, self-exploration, and impactful storytelling through digital media and video production.

In addition to his work in entertainment, Alberto Carlos is passionate about arts education, working with students with disabilities in theatre and media arts in the St. Augustine, FL, area. Through his teaching, he empowers young artists to find their creative voice and express themselves through performance and storytelling.

Now based in Florida, Alberto Carlos continues to write, produce, perform, and educate, bringing depth and authenticity to every project.
