Erin Barnes is a musical powerhouse based in sunny Jacksonville, Florida. With over 15 years of experience, Erin has conquered the local music scene as a pianist, singer, director, and actor extraordinaire. Her performances at Players by the Sea, Theatre Jacksonville, and the 5 & Dime have made her a household name in the community. Her favorite roles include the sassy Tracey in “Sweat,” the ghoulish Morticia in “The Addams Family,” and the lovable Nellie in “South Pacific.” 

But Erin isn't just a performer—she's also a dedicated educator who has taught music and musical theatre to aspiring artists of all ages. She was a full-time music teacher at Assumption Catholic School, and she currently teaches musical theatre at Camp Theatre Jacksonville while running her private studio for piano and voice students. When Erin isn't belting out show tunes or teaching the next generation of stars, you can find her singing with the beloved Bella Voce choral group. Erin Barnes is the complete package—a talented musician, a passionate educator, and a force to be reckoned with on the stage!
