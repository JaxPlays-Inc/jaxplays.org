Abigail Douglas is an incoming sophomore at the Hartt School, getting her BFA degree in Musical Theatre. You could have seen her around town at the Alhambra in *Seussical*, *Sound of Music*, and *[[production:2018 Elf|Elf]]*, at FSCJ in *Cinderella*, or at Players by the Sea in *[[production:2022 Ruthless!|Ruthless!]]* Her favorite credits include Winnie Foster in *Tuck Everlasting* and Ensemble in *Rock of Ages* in Michigan last summer. This has been the most wonderful experience to be able to perform again and would like to thank the entire production team for making this show possible.
