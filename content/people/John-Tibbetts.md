Other highlights include singing as a soloist with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, and more recently singing Britten's *War Requiem* & Orff's *Carmina Burana* with the American Festival Orchestra. Tibbetts made his international operatic and film debut in 2021 singing the role of Adam in Huizinga's *Angel* with Toronto's Opera Atelier. Tibbetts also sang the role of Ping in Opera Grand Rapid's production of *Turandot*. In 2019, Tibbetts was lauded by South Florida Classical Review for his "adept, well-characterized performance" as Fiorello in *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* with Palm Beach Opera.
