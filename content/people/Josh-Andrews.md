Josh is a Jacksonville native who greatly loves his city. Growing up in town, Josh developed deep passions for three things: theatre & film, photography, and faith. Over the last five years, Josh has had the honor and privilege of owning and operating his own photography businesses, joining his church staff full-time in vocational ministry, and now being a co-founder of Lumen Rep - Jacksonville’s first regional, resident, repertory theatre. “The future for the city of Jacksonville is bright, and even brighter once Lumen Rep has cast its’ light toward the greater Jacksonville community - pun intended,” he says.
