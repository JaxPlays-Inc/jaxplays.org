Thomas F. Nehl, a prominent Jacksonville businessman, actor and philanthropist, left an indelible mark on the community through his diverse interests and generous spirit. Born in Portland, Oregon, Tom moved to Jacksonville as a young man and founded the [Tom Nehl Truck Company](https://www.tomnehl.com/). An Air Force veteran of World War II, he was deeply involved in local civic activities and a member of prestigious clubs such as the San Jose Country Club and the University Club.

Tom's passion for the arts was evident in his long-standing involvement in community theater, both as an actor and a supporter. He established the Tom Nehl Fund in 1993, through [The Community Foundation for Northeast Florida](https://www.jaxcf.org/), to bolster local theater productions, which has significantly impacted Jacksonville's theatrical scene by funding over $1 million in grants for production enhancements.
