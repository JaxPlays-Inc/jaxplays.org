Jason Woods is an award-winning actor with rave reviews for his just closed Off-Broadway run of [[production: 2024 Bing!]] (formerly known as *The Near Disaster of Jasper & Casper*). He also creates musicals and plays, all original works for over 12 years, including film. He is developing a limited series, and has completed a feature-length screenplay for his psychological drama, *The Reality of Nicholas Burke*. â€‹An autodidact, he writes, directs, and composes all of the orchestral music for his productions. If there is a word that describes his intentions in art and the magical exchange with an audience, that word is simply...transformation.
