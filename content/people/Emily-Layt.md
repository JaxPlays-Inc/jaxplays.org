Emily spends pretty much all of her free time on the [[theatre:Limelight Theatre|Limelight]] stage since moving to St. Augustine in 2021, with notable roles such as Judy in [[production:2024 9 to 5 The Musical|*9 to 5*]], Girl in *Once*, Lucille Frank in [[production:2022 Parade|*Parade*]], and Ann Deever in *All My Sons*. When she's not performing, Emily enjoys watching movies with friends, crocheting and practicing yoga. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Theatre Performance from the University of Central Missouri. Emily is grateful for the ongoing support of her family and friends, as well as the talented collaborators and volunteers in the local theatre community.
