Justin Sean Murphy is a versatile artist with a career spanning comics, theater, and film. He first gained recognition with his Civil War-themed comic, *Southern Blood*, before branching into theater. His play *Fallen Angel* won Most Outstanding Musical at the New York Fringe Festival. Murphy returned to comics with the award-winning *Cleburne* and is currently working on an animated feature, *Dawgtown*. His ambitious productions, like a well-received rendition of *Jesus Christ Superstar*, demonstrate a commitment to high-quality storytelling across multiple platforms.
