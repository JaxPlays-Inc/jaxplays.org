Barbara Colaciello brings a rich tapestry of experiences to her roles as an actress, director, playwright, and educator. Her career began in New York City, where she worked with Andy Warhol at the Factory as the Advertising Director of Interview Magazine. During this period, she continued her acting studies with acclaimed coaches Larry Moss and Peter Flood, and at Warren Robertson’s studio.

After relocating to Jacksonville, Florida in 1993, Barbara founded Inter-Act, a home-based acting program focusing on improvisation. She also hosted artistic soirées, which led to her role as Education and Outreach Director at [[theatre:Players by the Sea|Players by the Sea Theater]]. Her collaboration with poet and playwright Al Letson notably included bringing *Griot: He Who Speaks the Sweet Word* to the NYC International Fringe Festival, receiving critical acclaim.

Barbara’s one-woman show, Life on the Diagonal, debuted in New York at Theater Lab in 2008, praised for its authenticity and dynamic storytelling. She was commissioned by Players by the Sea and the [Cummer Museum of Arts and Gardens](https://www.cummermuseum.org/) to create and perform a solo show celebrating the museum's founder for its 50th anniversary.

Currently, Barbara heads Improv to the Rescue at [[theatre:BABS'LAB]], providing experiential learning workshops that foster communication, storytelling and collaboration.
