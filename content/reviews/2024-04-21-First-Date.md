[*First Date*](/productions/2024-first-date/) is a hilarious and charming musical that follows the story of Aaron (Mitchell Wohl), a nervous investment banker, and Casey (Mary Elizabeth Schubert), a quick-witted artist, who are set up on a blind date at a bustling New York City cafe. Throughout their evening, their inner anxieties and hopes burst into life with the unexpected interventions of their ex-partners, overbearing relatives and a gaggle of imaginary advisors who appear out of the ether to dish out advice, often comically unsolicited.<!--more--> 

With each revealing conversation and whimsical musical number, Aaron and Casey peel back the layers of first impressions and missteps to uncover potential sparks of a genuine connection. This contemporary musical explores the most terrifying and exhilarating aspects of dating in the modern world with a blend of sharp humor and genuine emotion, making it an engaging experience for anyone who has ever been on a first date.

Upon entering the Matuza Mainstage at the Limelight Theatre, audience members are immediately transported to a hip, downtown cafe, thoughtfully rendered through a simple yet effective set design. Tables neatly arranged upstage and a bar adorned with a backdrop of the silhouettes of beer, wine and liquor bottles create an inviting urban space. This atmosphere is enhanced by real artworks by St. Augustine-based artist Lisette Lugo, which lend an authentic touch to the cafe's walls.

Mitchell Wohl, in the role of Aaron, particularly stood out with his adorably nervous yet hilariously commanding presence. Throughout the musical, his adept use of body language brings an additional layer of depth to his character. For instance, his nervous energy is palpable through his restless movements and tentative glances, which gradually evolve into more assured, expansive gestures as his confidence grows over the course of the date.

Wohl carries the role with deep sincerity and authentic vulnerability, anchoring his performance in a profound emotional reality that resonates strongly with the audience. His delivery of “In Love With You” was a comically explosive surprise. Conversely, his duet with Caitlin Mahoney on "The Things I Never Said" was deeply moving, eliciting tears through their raw portrayal of disappointment, deep sadness and regret. Wohl's ability to navigate such a wide spectrum of emotions not only highlights his versatility as an actor but also enriches the entire theatrical experience, making his performance a standout element of the production.

Mary Elizabeth Schubert delivered a compelling portrayal of Casey, skillfully capturing the complexity of her character through nuanced acting that adeptly balanced sarcasm, wit and fragility. While her vocal performances did not match the power of her acting, there were promising glimpses of growth. Schubert's ability to connect emotionally with the audience, even in moments of vocal uncertainty, suggested a burgeoning talent that, with further vocal coaching and experience, could evolve significantly in future roles.

The ensemble cast infused the production with remarkable energy and depth, seamlessly supporting the leading roles while maintaining a subtle presence. However, when the spotlight turned to them, their performances were fantastic, showcasing their individual talents and significantly enhancing the overall fabric of the show.

Caitlin Mahoney and Chad Boyd excelled as the metaphorical angels—or perhaps demons—on the protagonists' shoulders, personifying the mental projections of Aaron's best friend, Gabe, and Casey's sister, Lauren. They infused the production with comedic relief and insightful, albeit entirely unsolicited, commentary through their interactions, vividly representing the inner thoughts and dilemmas faced by Aaron and Casey.

Emily Layt delivers a delightful performance, combining humor and sharp judgment as the hilariously blunt Grandma Ida, and transforming into a seductive yet wicked Allison, engaging the audience with her dynamic range.

Jan Peter Buksar and Collin James truly stole the show with their outstanding performances. Collin James was irresistibly funny as Reggie, Casey's obnoxious and flamboyant best friend, and as Aaron’s future son, bringing an insane amount of energy and a Chris Farley-like mastery of physical comedy to the stage. His presence was magnetic, turning every scene he was in into a comedic highlight. 

Jan Peter Buksar delivered standout performances across his roles, especially as the Waiter and Casey’s Father. But it was his side-splitting portrayal of Blaze that stole the spotlight. Despite having almost no lines, Buksar's impeccable comedic timing and expressive performance as Blaze elicited huge bursts of laughter from the audience and turned the character into a hilarious highlight of the show.

The direction of *First Date* masterfully harnessed the energy and comedic talent of the cast, striking a fine balance between raucous humor and deeply heartfelt moments that captivated the audience. Michael Lipp’s skillful handling of the cast’s dynamics was evident in the natural and lively blocking observed throughout the production, showcasing a keen eye for both the subtleties and complexities of theatrical staging.

However, the staging of the final scene, where the characters remained stationary while singing to the audience, marked a slight departure from the fluidity of the rest of the show. Incorporating more movement in this scene might have preserved the continuity of action and emotional buildup to the finale.

The lighting design in *First Date* was brilliantly executed, enhancing the narrative by clearly demarcating moments of reality and magical realism.  In the final scene, innovative lighting vividly transformed the set without altering a single set piece.

Unfortunately, the production faced its share of challenges right from the start, suffering from technical audio issues that ranged from poor microphone equalization to intensely loud feedback that caused the entire audience to groan. These issues were severe enough to necessitate the turning off of the microphones multiple times. 

Despite these technical difficulties, the cast displayed remarkable professionalism, maintaining their performance integrity without a hitch. *First Date* at the Limelight Theatre was an absolute riot and emerged as an uproarious success. With their unwavering professionalism and comedic brilliance, the cast not only overcame these challenges but also managed to captivate and entertain the audience thoroughly. From the sharp wit in the script to the infectious energy on stage, this musical comedy delivered nonstop laughter and memorable moments. The audience left the theater buzzing with delight, making *First Date* a truly memorable experience that highlighted the magic of live theater—imperfections and all.
