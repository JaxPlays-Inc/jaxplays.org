[*Trouble in Mind*](/productions/2024-trouble-in-mind/) at [Players by the Sea](/theatres/players-by-the-sea) is a compelling, provacative and sometimes hilarious dramatic comedy that whisks audiences to the backstage world of 1950s New York City. The play centers around Wiletta Mayer, a talented, veteran Black actress who, after years of playing secondary characters, finally lands a lead role in a Broadway-bound play. Her excitement quickly sours when she discovers that her character perpetuates biased stereotypes. <!--more-->

Set against the backdrop of the play's rehearsals, directed by a white man with a supposedly progressive script, Wiletta grapples with the dilemma of voicing her truth against systemic prejudices or compromising her values for the sake of her career. This conflict ignites a poignant exploration of artistic integrity, racial identity and the painful concessions often made in the quest for equality on and off the stage.

Zonnetta Marie delivers a riveting performance as Wiletta. At the outset of *Trouble in Mind*, Zonnetta skillfully portrays a woman who appears initially content, relieved to have finally secured the role she has long desired. Her willingness to capitulate to the whims and ego of her bosses, particularly the director Al Manners, is palpable. She portrays this compromise as a necessary sacrifice, part of the unspoken contract she believes she must adhere to in order to succeed.

As the play progresses, Marie's portrayal deepens as she channels a firestorm of emotions that gradually crescendo as her character slowly peels away years of compromise. Her portrayal of Wiletta Mayer's transformation from muted subservience to defiant self-assertion, is both powerful and profoundly inspiring. Marie's ability to navigate these complex emotional landscapes showcases a remarkable range and depth in her performance, making her transformation one of the highlights of the production.

Jay Bilderback likewise delivers an exceptional performance as director Al Manners, a driven artist with seemingly noble intentions. His portrayal of Al is like a tempest, swirling with noble intentions before unleashing the stormy reality of deep-seated biases. Passionate about pushing boundaries and creating theater that resonates deeply with audiences, Bilderback imbues the role with dynamic physicality, reflecting the stress and energy of a man committed to his artistic ambitions.

As the story unfolds, Al's authoritative and often abusive demeanor is revealed not just as the harsh demands of a perfectionist but as a troubling mix of cultural insensitivity and manipulative behavior beneath his artistic facade. Bilderback delivers a performance that is both intriguing and unsettling, leaving audiences grappling with the uncomfortable truths behind a character they thought they understood.

The supporting cast enriches the narrative, bringing to life the nuanced dynamics of their characters. Shelby Ellis as the naive and entitled Judy Sears, Katrina Melvin as the pragmatic Millie Davis, and Neal Thorburn as Bill O'Wray, who oscillates between offstage anxiety and onstage command, enrich the narrative with diverse conflicts and perspectives. Ja'uan Hay provides a poignant character arc as John Nevins, who evolves from naivety to a hardened sense of reality, mirroring the compromises often made by artists in challenging industries. Michael G. Robinson brings a much-needed lightness as Sheldon Forrester, whose humor punctuates the play’s heavier moments, adding layers to his dramatic monologue that hits harder because of it.

The ensemble's background performances expertly heighten the drama, particularly during confrontations between Wiletta and Al, drawing the audience deeper into the play's emotional core.

Bradley Akers's set design for *Trouble in Mind* ingeniously transforms the John McManus Mainstage Theatre into a vivid recreation of a 1950s Broadway stage. The stage is stripped bare and all curtains are lifted, exposing the full backstage area, with old props and lights laid about, exposed pipes and exits to the dressing rooms and the subway station. This includes a meticulously crafted faux fly system with sandbag counterweights, adapting to the venue's smaller scale while preserving period authenticity. This setup, along with unconventional cast entrances from the main theater entrance and the production booth, fosters a unique atmosphere where the audience feels like ghosts in the room — present and intimately close to the unfolding action, yet unseen by the cast.

Phedre Delinois's costume design in *Trouble in Mind* is equally exceptional, playing a crucial role in bringing the 1950s setting and characters to life with authenticity and visual flair. The costumes are not only period-accurate but also feel lived-in, reflecting the personal histories and psychological depth of each character. Notable among the selections are Judy's elegant ascot, which signifies her privileged background, and Sheldon's almost-comically oversized jacket and pants that enhance his character's humorous yet poignant presence. In stark contrast, Al's meticulously tailored suit, complete with a vest, underscores his rigid, controlling nature. Delinois also implements a subtle yet significant shift in the color palette and brightness of the costumes from the first to the second act. This transition mirrors the deepening of the play's themes, as the narrative shifts from lighter interactions to confronting more serious, darker issues in the play-within-a-play, effectively using costume as a narrative tool to signal the evolving emotional landscape.

*Trouble in Mind* cleverly exposes the painful concessions that artists — particularly those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups — are forced to make on the altar of societal progress. It powerfully underscores the truth that representation matters, not just within the cast, but among the entire team of creators and collaborators who shape the story. The production at Players by the Sea delivers a poignant blend of comedy and drama, captivating audiences with its sharp critique of racial dynamics in the theater world, tackling issues that remain just as relevant — if not more so — today as they were nearly 70 years ago when the play was written. Stellar performances by Zonnetta Marie and Jay Bilderback anchor the production, while the inventive set and costume designs amplify the 1950s ambiance, enhancing the play's impact. This thought-provoking production skillfully navigates complex themes, making it an essential viewing experience that resonates long after the audience's resounding applause fades.
