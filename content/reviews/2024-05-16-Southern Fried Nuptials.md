Following the rollicking success of *[Southern Fried Funeral](/productions/2022-southern-fried-funeral/)* in 2022, [St. Marys Little Theatre](/theatres/st-marys-little-theatre/) brings audiences back to the bayou bliss of New Edinburgh, Mississippi, with its sequel, [*Southern Fried Nuptials*](/productions/2024-southern-fried-nuptials-2/). The play is as delightful and comforting as a warm Southern evening, filled with the laughter and eccentricities one would expect from a family wedding set in the heart of the South.

At the core of *Southern Fried Nuptials* is the impending wedding of Harlene Frye and Atticus Van Leer. Harlene has been repeatedly postponing the wedding to the frustration of everyone in the family, especially her fiancé. The reason for her hesitation remains a mystery until her old flame from Texas, Carter Canfield, shows up with shocking news that turns everything upside down. This unexpected arrival sets off a chain reaction of comedic mishaps and heartfelt revelations, pushing the family to confront their feelings and strengthen their bonds amidst the chaos.

Slipping back into their roles as Harlene and Atty seemingly effortlessly, Debra Parsons and Ken Johnson exude sweetness and sincerity, despite the mayhem surrounding them.

The prodigal daughter, Harlene, is still deeply insecure, feeling unworthy of the love and support from her fiancé, mother and sister. Debra Parsons brings out all those emotions with admirable nuance, making the audience empathize with Harlene's fear of abandonment. Even though the root of her self-loathing is never fully revealed, Parsons' performance makes her vulnerability and fear relatable.

Ken Johnson has grown significantly  as an actor since he was last on stage as Atticus Van Leer. His performance now showcases a much broader range of emotional depth and versatility. The raw pain and simmering anger he brings to the role are striking, delivering a powerful and heartfelt impact, while his indignation is both intense and convincing.

Tammy Bradley brings depth to her reprisal of the role of Dorothy Frye, the kind and loving mother still mourning her husband's death because she hasn't allowed herself to fully processing her grief and move on. Although Dorothy has less stage time in this show compared to the last, Bradley's heartfelt and endearing performance makes a significant impact. Her portrayal leaves the audience wishing for more moments with Dorothy, whose warmth adds a poignant layer to the production.

Nichole Sternad and Travis Land share such a natural chemistry on stage as wife and husband, Sammie Jo Frye-Lefette and Beecham Lefette, that it prompted a second look at the cast list to confirm they aren't actually married. Sternad, portraying the uptight and self-righteous eldest sister, excellently embodies the role of a codependent sibling who struggles to relinquish control while believing she is being helpful.

Susan Langenbahn shines as she takes on a more dramatic role as Martha Ann Fox, showcasing her versatility after her absolutely hilarious performances in *Southern Fried Funeral* and *Savannah Sipping Society*. Her dynamic with Tammy Bradley's Dorothy is heartfelt and authentic, portraying a friendship that feels genuine and long-lasting.

Vicki Wyttenbach skillfully portrays Ozella Meeks, the nosy busybody who appoints herself the wedding planner. Wyttenbach captures Ozella's pent-up frustration and shines in the physical comedy, humorously depicting her overly enthusiastic efforts to manage every detail of the wedding.

Carlos Semidei steals every scene he is in with his over-the-top antics and exaggerated facial expressions that are a performance unto themselves as the antagonist Carter Canfield. Semidei's Canfield is also uproariously narcissistic, assuming everyone else is just as much in love with him as he is. The scenes where Fairy June flirts with him are particularly amusing, adding even more humor to the mix. The conflict between Canfield and Dorothy Frye is especially comical, showcasing Semidei's great comedic timing and physicality. His energetic and hilarious performance makes Canfield a standout character in the production.

Juliana Mabe is adorable as Dewey Jr., bringing boundless energy and a ridiculous, out-of-touch charm to the role. Gloria Hurley adds a dependable but delightful dose of humor as the dimwitted Fairy June Cooper, while George Tweedy's performance as the kindly widower Vester Pickens adds a heartwarming element to the ensemble.

*Southern Fried Nuptials* at St. Marys Little Theatre is a charming production, offering a welcoming and accessible experience.  Fans of *Southern Fried Funeral* will particularly appreciate this sequel, though it also stands strongly on its own. The play is thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining, capturing the essence of Southern charm and the humor of family gatherings. The cast's performances infuse the stage with warmth and humor, making it a perfect choice for an evening filled with lighthearted fun and touching moments.
