His disheveled appearance adds to the comedic moment as Julia (played by Brooklyn Klekamp), dressed in a pink apron over a black dress, stands nearby, smiling with concern. The brightly lit stage contrasts with the gritty setting of the alley, creating a humorous juxtaposition of romance in unlikely places."

[[production:2024 The Wedding Singer]] at the [[theatre:Alhambra Theatre & Dining]] brings the electric energy of the '80s to life in a bold, colorful and heartfelt production. Directed by [[person:Shain Stroff]], this reinterpretation of the beloved 1998 Adam Sandler movie captures both the nostalgic charm of the original and injects fresh, creative twists that make it a joy for both new audiences and longtime fans.<!--more-->

Although *[[w:The Wedding Singer]]* film seems almost turnkey-ready for a jukebox musical, with its abundance of ‘80s hits like "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" and "Love Stinks" woven into the storyline, composer Matthew Sklar and lyricist Chad Beguelin went in a different direction for the stage adaptation. Rather than building the score from pre-existing hits, they penned an almost entirely original set of songs that earned them Tony and Drama Desk nominations for Best Original Score and Outstanding Music. Adam Sandler's "Somebody Kill Me" and "Grow Old With You" are the only two songs from the film that made it into the musical, but the new songs are so catchy and well-crafted that they feel like they could have been part of the original soundtrack. Most importantly, they do a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of character and plot development, something the film's score didn't have to do.

From the very first number, "It's Your Wedding Day," the cast bursts onto the stage with a vibrant explosion of movement and sound. [[person:Jake Pearce]], as Robbie Hart, sets the tone with his infectious energy. Pearce embodies Robbie’s emotional highs and lows with admirable range — from the goofy optimism of a wedding singer in love to the crushing heartbreak that follows his failed relationship. His standout moment comes during “Somebody Kill Me,” which is reimagined as an acoustic, more reflective number. While it loses some of the extreme dark absurdity from the film, the emotional weight lands with more impact, thanks to Pearce’s nuanced delivery.

[[person:Brooklyn Klekamp]], as Julia Sullivan, shines as the heart of the show. Her portrayal strikes a perfect balance between adorable and strong, showing Julia’s grace and quiet determination. A particularly charming moment occurs during "Someday," where Klekamp pantomimes being a bride, mirroring the character she watches on stage. It’s a deceptively simple-looking bit of choreography that underscores Julia’s quiet longing while adding a layer of tenderness to her character. Klekamp’s chemistry with Pearce’s Robbie develops with a careful, gradual crescendo, starting with a friendly, platonic bond that gradually deepens. Their interactions evolve subtly, building romantic tension with each scene until their connection blossoms fully just before the finale, making their love story feel both authentic and believable.

[[person: Nick Cooper]]’s George is more than just a Boy George parody — he’s a lovable, enthusiastic fanboy with a personality all his own. Cooper adds unexpected layers to the character, making him not only hilarious but also genuinely charming. His George brings warmth and uniqueness to every scene, creating a character who feels like he has his own story to tell and leaving the audience eager for more of his presence on stage.

Rosie Hart, Robbie’s quirky and lovable grandmother, played by [[person:Cathy Merkle Roddy]], never fails to get a laugh with her antics, but there’s also a sweetness to the character that Roddy brings out beautifully. Whether she’s engaging in humorous banter or showing Robbie tough love, Roddy’s Rosie is as endearing as she is hilarious.

Then there’s [[person:Jessie Roddy]]’s Holly, a firecracker of a character with a ridiculous but spot-on New Jersey accent. While Holly could easily be a one-dimensional party girl, Roddy adds depth through sharp comedic timing and moments of vulnerability. When she belts out “Right in Front of Your Eyes,” she not only delivers powerful vocals but also manages to convey Holly’s confidence and hidden longing for something more. Roddy’s dynamic presence elevates the character, making her a standout in every scene.

[[person:Keegan Smith]] plays Glen Gulia with the perfect amount of sleaze, channeling *Glengarry Glen Ross* and *American Psycho* vibes with his slicked-back hair and sharp charcoal suit. His portrayal of Julia’s cold-hearted fiancé oozes arrogance, and Smith leans into the character’s villainy with a deliciously smarmy performance. His scenes radiate tension, making Glen a fitting foil to Robbie’s earnestness.

[[person:Jen Brooks]] as Linda, Robbie’s ex-fiancée delivers the rock anthem “Let Me Come Home” with such raw power and sensuality that it’s hard not to admire the character, even if we deeply despise her. Brooks expertly plays Linda as a woman we love to hate — she’s brash, unapologetic and owns every second she’s on stage.

[[person:Michael Roddy]], the third member of the talented Roddy family in *The Wedding Singer* cast, is a true scene-stealer from the ensemble with his versatile comedic performances. He shifts effortlessly between playing too many wildly distinctive characters to count, including an irate father of the bride, an indifferent bartender and ultimately bringing the house down as a heroic Elvis impersonator. His comedic timing and animated physicality turn each role into a memorable moment, leaving the audience eagerly awaiting his next appearance.

Choreographer [[person:Erick Ariel Sureda]]’s work is consistently a highlight throughout the show. From the razor-sharp ensemble performances to the clever use of props — like Robbie’s corded microphone in “Casualty of Love” — the choreography is inventive and thrilling. “Saturday Night in the City” is a neon-lit spectacle, an eruption of color and movement that embodies the chaotic, vibrant energy of the era. The dancers execute with precision, and their sheer joy on stage is contagious.

The technical elements of *The Wedding Singer* are equally impressive. [[person:Carly Meyer]]’s sound design is particularly exceptional in this production, especially during the lead-up to “Casualty of Love,” where the effect of Robbie screaming into a corded mic is done so skillfully that it feels authentically real, while never overdriving the sound system, causing feedback or losing clarity. This moment, combined with the creative staging, makes for a thrilling, immersive experience.

[[person: David Dionne]]'s innovative set design adds remarkable depth to the production, utilizing every inch of the stage’s vertical and horizontal space. One standout element is the brilliant integration of the wedding tables at the very front edge of the stage. This ingenious design allows those cast members to serve as background actors, staying integrated in the scene without stealing focus, subtly enhancing the overall composition.

Another particularly impressive design is the dumpster scene in "Come Out of the Dumpster," where the interplay between Klekamp's Julia, Pearce’s Robbie and the set creates a charming, comedic moment. The lighting, vibrant throughout, reaches its dramatic peak during the reprise of “Not That Kind of Thing / If I Told You,” where the use of distance and shadow highlights the emotional separation between Robbie and Julia.

While much of the production mirrors the humor and beats of the original film, certain moments lack the emotional punch of the movie, and the comedic timing of some of the punchlines from the original script falls a little flat. However, what the musical adds — like the hilarious pop star impersonators — offers plenty of fresh laughs and surprises. The new song “If I Told You” feels like the perfect '80s movie ballad that never was, cementing itself as a standout addition to the show’s already infectious score.

Overall, [[production:2024 The Wedding Singer]] at [[theatre:Alhambra Theatre & Dining]] is a joyous celebration of love, humor and music, wrapped in a vibrant, retro package. With sharp performances, stellar choreography and creative direction, it captures the spirit of the 1980s while adding depth to characters we thought we already knew. This production is a blast from start to finish, a love letter to the era that feels fresh and engaging for modern audiences.
