[[production:2024 Lizzie]] at [[theatre:The 5 & Dime]] takes audiences into the dark, feverish world of one of history’s most notorious true-crime stories: the sensational, bloody saga of Lizzie Borden. This rock musical delves into Lizzie’s tumultuous life, weaving together themes of oppression, desire and, ultimately, explosive female rage. With a modern, hard-hitting rock score, *Lizzie* reimagines the story, capturing the inner turmoil and fury of a young woman pushed to the brink. 

In the title role, [[person:Sara Beth Sohn]] is mesmerizing as Lizzie, giving her a gripping, dynamic portrayal filled with both fury and vulnerability. Throughout the show, she shapes Lizzie into a fully fleshed-out character, balancing sarcastic wit with deep anguish. Sohn’s performance hits an apex in "This Is Not Love," where Lizzie’s pain and desperation are palpable. Lizzie spirals into unhinged intensity during “The Soul of the White Bird,” her vocal prowess matching the character’s fractured psyche.  Sohn’s voice embodies both beauty and menace, pain and power, creating a magnetic presence that draws the audience into Lizzie’s turmoil.

[[person:Catie Casey]] is a force of nature as Emma, Lizzie’s fiercely loyal yet seething sister, embodying her character’s fury and resentment in every movement and note. Her rendition of "Sweet Little Sister" is especially striking, where she channels rockstar energy and immense rage without losing her fierce loyalty to Lizzie. Casey adds an unforgettable layer to the tension between the siblings, balancing Emma’s anger with unbreakable devotion. Casey is completely captivating as she explodes with punk energy in “What the F#%k Now, Lizzie?”

As Lizzie's friend, Alice Russell, [[person:Angie Acedera]] brings depth and warmth, heartbreakingly conveying Alice’s unrequited love for Lizzie with beautiful nuance. Acedera’s voice is both powerfully emotive and pristine, cutting through the heavy rock instrumentation with a haunting quality. She and Sohn achieve a delicate balance of intimacy, hinting at Alice’s tragic loyalty to a love that may never be returned. Acedera’s portrayal captures the duality of Alice’s love and her steadfast commitment to truth, layering vulnerability and resilience with poignant clarity.

[[person:Elizabeth Bricknell]]’s portrayal of Maggie — later Bridget — adds much-needed levity with subtle, yet impeccable comic timing, impressive physicality and well-timed reactions. Bricknell embodies the dual roles with finesse, playing off her character’s shift in identity with wry humor, especially in scenes where her dry wit and physical expressiveness shine.

Musical Director [[person:Erin Barnes]] brings out the best in the rock-heavy score, achieving a powerful mix between band and vocals that emphasizes the punk aesthetic. The band, which sounds phenomenal throughout, is especially dynamic during moments like the electric guitar solo, where the guitarist steps out of the pit, drawing the audience directly into the gritty soundscape. The group numbers, especially “Burn the Old Thing Up,” showcase tight vocal blending that captures both aggression and unity within the fractured Borden household, and the harmonies in “Watchmen for the Morning” are particularly haunting. “Why Are All These Heads Off?” bursts with raw, electrifying riot grrrl energy, as the cast channels fierce rebellion and a visceral, almost chaotic energy into a cathartic, high-octane anthem of defiance.

Under [[person:Abby Gomez]]’s direction, *Lizzie* is intense and unapologetically raw, capturing the turmoil of Lizzie Borden’s world with striking focus. Gomez masterfully paces the show, balancing moments of rage and vulnerability to build a palpable tension that pulls the audience in. Several numbers, like “Gotta Get Out of Here,” could benefit from more interesting and dynamic movement to match the rest of the show’s fervor. However, [[person:Adrianna Williams]]’s choreography in “Questions, Questions” effectively conveys the characters’ sense of entrapment, with fans and scarves adding visual layers that reflect the complexity and tension of the story.

The lighting and set design are minimal yet effective. The dark, shadow-heavy lighting amplifies the mood, while carefully placed spotlights keep the focus on the emotional core of each performance. Although some audience members report difficulty hearing vocals from the front row, the mix sounds impeccable from further back, closer to the speakers, capturing the full intensity of both vocals and instruments without overwhelming one or the other.

*Lizzie* at The 5 & Dime lingers like an electric charge, a dark, fevered whirlwind of raw emotion and rebellion. This isn’t just a recounting of a notorious crime; it’s a visceral dive into the jagged edges of female rage and survival. The production brings Lizzie Borden’s infamous story to life with a punk edge that’s as unrelenting as it is gripping, blending powerhouse rock vocals with moments of biting sarcasm and unguarded vulnerability. Fueled by a cast that dives into every dark corner of rage and resilience, Lizzie feels alive with tension, making each song, scream and silence crackle with purpose. By the end, it’s less a performance you applaud and more a storm you emerge from, buzzing with the aftershock of a story that refuses to stay buried.
