[[production: 2025 My Fair Lady]], a beloved staple of golden age musical theater, tells the story of Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower girl who meets a pompous phonetics professor and undergoes a dramatic transformation under his hand. Professor Higgins makes a bet that, after his schooling, he could pass her off as a proper lady at a high-society event by simply teaching her to speak proper English. However, during his tenure as her teacher, those involved with the bet are forced to question their ideas of class, identity and societal expectations. The [[theatre:Alhambra Theatre & Dining]]’s *My Fair Lady* does complete justice to this classic, with an immensely talented cast, great costume design, energetic choreography, impeccable dialect work and gorgeous vocals.

In the role of Eliza Doolittle, [[person:Sofia Smith]] delivers a triumph of a performance. With a crystal-clear voice and a soaring musical theatre mix, her Eliza is a ball of energy. Some of her standout songs include “The Rain in Spain,” “Just You Wait” and “I Could Have Danced All Night.” With a role like Eliza, where dialect is such an integral and complicated part of her character — Smith performs it with ease. Her animated inflections command the stage and keep the energy soaring through the entire show.

Opposite her, [[person:Gary Lee Webber]] plays Henry Higgins with a sophisticated edge. His diction and posture exude refinement, and his dialect work is commendable — it is crisp, which is a vital part of his characterization. Impressively, he leans into the character’s unlikable qualities with confidence, allowing the audience to grapple with Higgins’ arrogance and transformation — or lack thereof. His chemistry with [[person:Andy Moritz]]’s Colonel Pickering is engaging and authentic.

[[person:Alexander Blanco]], in the lovesick role of Freddy, delivers a performance that is both tender and romantic. His lovely tenor voice, particularly in “On the Street Where You Live,” underscores Freddy’s yearning and deep infatuation with Eliza. Freddy is a smaller but memorable role, and Blanco ensures that his sincerity shines through.

One of the show’s most delightful elements is [[person:Pete Clapsis]] as Alfred P. Doolittle, Eliza’s roguish, drunkard father. His comedic timing is impeccable. There is excitement every time he walks on stage. All of his appearances build up to his best number: "Get Me to the Church on Time." It is a hilarious, high-energy masterpiece that highlights not only Clapsis’ performance ability but the production’s attention to ensemble harmony and spirited staging.

[[person:Tod Booth]]’s direction delivers a seamless and engaging interpretation, with creative staging that cleverly utilizes the unique setup of the Alhambra to transition between scenes without interrupting the flow of the show. Choreographer [[person:Erick Ariel Sureda]] brings high energy to each musical number, where the ensemble’s dynamic movement brings the stage to life. The ensemble as a whole is a standout — consistently engaging and synchronized, they make each scene more vibrant.

Costume designers [[person:Camala Pitts]] and [[person:Dorinda Quiles]] also deserve high praise. Though period piece costuming can present challenges, they excel — especially in the Ascot horse race scene, where the ensemble’s stark and elegant costumes elevate the visual storytelling. The black-and-white palette, a hallmark of this scene, does wonders for building the world of the rigid high-society crowd.

Of course, part of the charm of the Alhambra experience is the fact that it is a dinner theater, meaning the dining element is an important part of the audience experience. The service throughout the evening is friendly and efficient, and they maintain the atmosphere of an elegant night out. The English-inspired menu complements [[production: 2025 My Fair Lady]]’s setting nicely in concept, but in execution, some dishes leave a bit to be desired. While I appreciated the effort to thematically pair the cuisine with the show, some of the entrées missed the mark — with undercooked rice and dry chicken, for instance. However, it is worth commending the kitchen for offering a plant-based option, which I personally enjoyed. Another successful dish is the Mulligatawny soup. A bit more attention to seasoning and consistency could elevate the dining portion of the evening to match the quality on stage.

Overall, Alhambra’s [[production: 2025 My Fair Lady]] is a rich and thoroughly enjoyable production that honors the original while bringing a fresh energy to the stage. With standout performances, great visual storytelling and a strong ensemble, it is a shining example of how a classic can still feel full of life. Whether you're new to the story or revisiting a favorite, this production is well worth the visit.
