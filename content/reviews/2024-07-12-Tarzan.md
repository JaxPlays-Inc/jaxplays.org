[[theatre:Players by the Sea]]'s latest production of *[[production:2024 Tarzan|Tarzan]]* plunges its audience into a lush, vibrant jungle, transforming both the lobby and the theater into a fully immersive experience that blurs the lines between stage and seating. As the house lights dim, the audience is immediately drawn into the world of Tarzan through a poignant and creatively rendered shadow-play that recounts the character's beginnings, setting a profound emotional tone from the outset.<!--more-->

The story follows the titular character, Tarzan, as he navigates the complexities of identity and bridging the gap between his wild upbringing and his human instincts. Raised by gorillas in the lush African jungle, Tarzan’s peaceful existence is shattered when he encounters humans like himself for the first time. With heart-pounding music by Phil Collins, including the Academy Award winning "You'll Be in My Heart," as well as "Son of Man," "Two Worlds" and nine new songs written for the show, this musical captures the drama of Tarzan’s dual existence and his quest for belonging.

Jereme Raickett's brilliant set design transforms the John McManus Mainstage Theatre into a vivid jungle landscape. His design is not only immersive but also beautifully worn, conveying the untamed and aged essence of a real jungle environment. The set's depth and dimension are particularly striking, allowing the large cast to utilize the entire space effectively -- both vertically and horizontally -- which enhances the dynamic storytelling. Raickett cleverly integrates functional elements like monkey bars and padded flooring into the naturalistic design. These features are not merely aesthetic; they are critical to the choreography and blocking, providing the actors with opportunities to explore their physicality without distracting from the visual coherence of the setting. This thoughtful integration ensures that every aspect of the set contributes to a seamless and engaging theatrical experience. Raickett's lighting design is equally visually striking, using color and intensity to beautifully evoke a range of emotions scene by scene. 

The ape family ensemble bounds onto the stage bringing the jungle to vibrant life, showcasing incredible physicality and flawless choreography. Their dynamic presence is further enhanced by Tracy Olin’s masterful costume design, which abstractly suggest the form and essence of apes. Every cubic inch of the stage is filled with actors leaping, swinging and flipping, yet never sacrificing vocal clarity, maintaining a crispness in their performances that is as impressive as their acrobatics. The extraordinary collaboration between Director Mike Beaman, Choreographer Emma Cate Davis and Music Director Anthony Felton sculpts an ensemble in *Tarzan* marked by intense, dynamic movement, richly drawn characters and outstanding vocal delivery.

Jeremy Obach’s Kerchak balances the stern authority of the ape leader with a protective impulse that resonates through his commanding stage presence. Kala, as played by Jocelyn Geronimo, exudes warmth and maternal care, her gentle handling of complex emotions highlighting the depth of her ape character. Full of mischief and energy, Elijah Simms plays Terk with a contagious enthusiasm, bringing an irrepressible joy to the stage.

Elijah Lawless, as Young Tarzan, captures the audience's attention from his very first moment on stage with a remarkable performance that belies his age. From his dynamic entry during the duet "Who Better Than Me?" with Terk, he commands the stage with a blend of adorable wildness and impressive theatrical presence, making it a highlight of the show.

Chris Berry brings Tarzan to life with an unmatched intensity and a physicality that breathes authenticity into the jungle-born character. He completely inhabits the character, immersing himself in Tarzan's wild instincts and human emotions. Berry's portrayal of Tarzan is a masterclass in physical theater, showcasing a seamless blend of strength and agility that perfectly captures the essence of the character. His ability to transition back and forth from incoherent to coherent speech as Tarzan learns English is a compelling demonstration of his range and skill. Throughout the course of the production, Berry dynamically expresses his character's development, both emotionally and mentally, as he learns to navigate the complexities of his identity. His physical transformation is equally impressive, as he evolves from a wild and untamed creature to a refined and noble hero.

Abigail Douglas splendidly executes the role of Jane with a compelling blend of elegance and intellectual prowess, her vocal performance resonating with strength and beauty. The chemistry between Douglas's Jane and Berry's Tarzan is both powerful and underscored by a sense of innocence, adding depth to their musically stunning duets and enhancing their emotional impact on the audience. Douglas deftly navigates the emotional complexities of her character's portrayal with a captivating blend of curiosity, vulnerability and strength.

Rounding out the supporting cast, Christopher Watson delivers a captivating performance as Clayton, blending sinister charm with a chilling progression deeper into villainy that keeps the audience enthralled. As Professor Porter, David Gowan embodies a delightful blend of wisdom, warmth and kindness, crafting a character with fatherly charm that is as loving as he is scholarly.

Words — and even photographs — fall short of capturing the emotional resonance and creative spectacle of *Tarzan*. To truly understand its depth and vibrancy, one must experience it live. It’s a production that demands to be seen, offering a profound experience for any devotee of cutting-edge musical theatre. It is an essential ticket for anyone who values groundbreaking musical theatre and storytelling.
