[[theatre:Players by the Sea]]'s latest production of *[[production:2024 Tarzan|Tarzan]]* plunges its audience into a lush, vibrant jungle, transforming both the lobby and the theater into a fully immersive experience that blurs the lines between stage and seating. As the house lights dim, the audience is immediately drawn into the world of Tarzan through a poignant and creatively rendered shadow-play that recounts the character's beginnings, setting a profound emotional tone from the outset.

Jereme Raickett's set design transforms the John McManus Mainstage Theatre into a vivid jungle landscape. His design is not only immersive but also beautifully worn, conveying the untamed and aged essence of a real jungle environment. The set's depth and dimension are particularly striking, allowing the large cast to utilize the entire space effectively—both vertically and horizontally—which enhances the dynamic storytelling. Raickett cleverly integrates functional elements like monkey bars and padded flooring into the naturalistic design. These features are not merely aesthetic; they are critical to the choreography and blocking, providing the actors with opportunities to explore their physicality without distracting from the visual coherence of the setting. This thoughtful integration ensures that every aspect of the set contributes to a seamless and engaging theatrical experience.

Raickett's lighting design was equally visually striking, using color and intensity to beautifully evoke a range of emotions scene by scene. However, there were moments where the lighting cues seemed misaligned, possibly due to last-minute changes in actor blocking or timing issues with the technicians. While these were minor distractions, they are likely to be corrected swiftly, ensuring a smoother visual flow in subsequent performances.
