In *A Small Fire,* the audience is drawn into the life-shattering ordeal of Emily Bridges, who is suddenly afflicted with a sensory loss that defies explanation, lacking both any apparent cause or cure. This profound crisis throws her once-controlled world into disarray, challenging her connections with her husband John, her daughter Jenny and her loyal employee Billy. As they navigate this uncharted territory, their deeply interwoven relationships are tested by the fear of the unknown, revealing the delicate balance between despair and hope in their struggle to adapt.

Brooks Anne Meirdierks, in her portrayal of Emily Bridges, captures a raw and relatable authenticity, riveting the audience from start to finish. She brings a genuineness to Emily’s hard exterior, forging a deep empathy among viewers. Her masterful depiction of Emily’s sensory loss is nuanced and heart-wrenchingly inspirational, navigating with grace and an affecting transparency.

One of the production's most unforgettable moments, is the scene where John shares the joy and beauty of everything he is seeing at the wedding with Emily. Meirdierks's ability to radiate joy, despite her character Emily's inability to see, showcases a remarkable range of emotional depth. The scene is a testament to the power of Meirdierks's performance, creating a visual and emotional spectacle that remains unseen yet vividly felt by the audience.

Bill Ratliff, as John Bridges, delivers a grounded, heartfelt performance, encapsulating the emotional journey of a husband overshadowed by his wife’s formidable presence. Ratliff portrays John with a subtle transformation from disconnectedness to a profound appreciation of life’s simple wonders, becoming the pillar of strength his wife needs.

Pauleen Conde, as Jenny Bridges, perfectly embodies her character. Conde's Jenny is a powerful, nuanced mix of vulnerability and burgeoning self-assurance, struggling for identity and self-worth in the shadow of her father's passivity.

Brian Niece’s direction and sound design elevate the production, blending raw realism with a cinematic ambiance. *A Small Fire* unfolds as if it were a slice of life, as if a documentary crew has intimately captured a family in the midst of navigating one of their most challenging periods. The script, brimming with quotable moments of brilliance, truly shines in its portrayal of the mundane, uncomfortable and imperfect aspects of life.
