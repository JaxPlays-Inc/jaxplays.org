In the shadowy corners of Limelight Theatreâ€™s Koger-Gamache Studio Theatre, *Wait Until Dark* draws the audience into a world where darkness is both a literal and metaphorical challenge. 

In Frederick Knott's gripping tale, Susy Hendrix, a blind woman, becomes entangled in a perilous scheme with three con men seeking a doll filled with drugs. As the plot thickens, Susy's sharp wits become her primary defense in a suspenseful battle of survival.<!--more-->

The meticulously designed set captures the essence of a 1960s New York apartment in all its detailed, lived-in glory. Every element, from the convincingly realistic radiator to the authentically aged paint on the walls, contributes to an atmosphere of authenticity that deepens the audience's immersion into the story. The only misstep in this otherwise flawless execution was the washing machine; despite being a major prop piece, it was clearly a plywood box. This stood in stark contrast to the time-period-accurate detailing of the rest of the set, noticeably breaking the suspension of disbelief whenever it came into play.

Anna Vera's portrayal of Susy Hendrix stands as a highlight of excellence in this production. Her authentic and lived-in depiction of a recently blinded woman captivates with its blend of convincing physicality and profound emotional depth. Vera navigates Susy's world of darkness with a nuanced balance of vulnerability and cunning. Her performance is marked by astute acting choices that bring depth to Susy's blindness, such as turning her face towards the sound of voices only after they begin talking, but orienting her ear towards sounds she's focusing on. Among her standout moments, Vera's accidental burn from the radiator while exploring the safe showcases her meticulous attention to character detail. This brief but potent detail, much like a masterfully delivered throwaway line, underscores the authenticity and depth of her portrayal.

Lucy Farrow's portrayal of Gloria in the production was quite impressive. She skillfully captured the essence of a bratty, insecure 9-year-old, making her character's temper tantrum an infuriating yet captivating spectacle. Farrow's confidence in her performance brought depth to Gloria's moments of insecurity and pain, making those scenes particularly impactful. Her ability to oscillate between these emotional states with such believability made every moment she was on stage a genuine delight for the audience.

Burt Kierstead and Chip Prestera delivered solid performances as Mike Talman and Sgt. Carlino, yet their energy fell short for their villainous roles. Despite having convincing New York accents, their characterizations veered somewhat towards the goofy, inadvertently softening the play's suspenseful edge. However, it's worth noting the difficulty of playing characters who are, in turn, portraying other characters. This layering of roles requires a nuanced approach, and both actors navigated these intricacies fairly well.

Joseph Stearman's Harry Roat, despite a late-game improvement, initially comes across as overly theatrical, lacking the gravitas to be truly frightening. However, there were notable highlights in his performance that deserve mention. When Stearman's Roat lost his temper at Carlino, his portrayal took a terrifying turn, showing glimpses of the menace that could have been. In another moment, his loss of control in a scene with Susy revealed a genuine fear that added a complex layer to his character. These instances suggested a potential depth to Roat that, if consistently tapped into, might have elevated the role's overall impact.

The use of off-stage action, particularly highlighted by sound, is a clever directorial choice that pays homage to Susy's blindness, allowing the audience to experience the action through her perspective. This, coupled with strategic lighting choices like the effective use of red light and built-in set lighting, showcases thoughtful design. However, the production faced challenges with awkward fight choreography and frustrating errors, such as two instances where supposedly locked doors were accidentally opened by actors.

The cast demonstrated remarkable skill in balancing projection and emotion, ensuring that their performances were not only felt but also heard with crisp clarity throughout the theatre. Achieving such audible dialogue is a challenging feat that eludes many productions. Their ability to maintain such consistency in projection significantly enhanced the immersive experience for the audience, allowing for complete engagement with the story from any seat in the house.

*Wait Until Dark* at Limelight Theatre offers a commendable rendition of Frederick Knott's suspenseful narrative. Led by the standout performances of Anna Vera and Lucy Farrow, the cast skillfully addresses the play's emotional and physical demands. Enhanced by meticulous set design, nuanced character portrayals and creative directorial choices, this production provides an engaging and entertaining evening, creating memorable moments of tension and resilience that offer a compelling reason to experience this classic thriller.
