When I heard that Alhambra was staging [[production:2024 A Christmas Story: The Musical]], my first reaction was, "Here we go again." Another beloved movie turned into a hollow, uninspired musical? But boy-howdy, was I off target.

[[theatre:Alhambra Theatre and Dining]]’s rendition doesn’t just capture the charm of the movie — it outshines it. It’s sharp, witty and bursting with energy, delivering laughs and heart like Ralphie landing a perfect shot on Black Bart. This isn’t just another adaptation; it’s a Christmas triumph!

Adult Ralphie, played by [[person:Jonathan Van Dyke]], narrates the scenes with quirky, humorous flair, often mirroring young Ralphie’s actions in his quest for a Red Ryder BB gun. Jonathan’s energy is a powerhouse, serving as the glue that holds the show together seamlessly.

Young Ralphie is brought to life by the talented [[person:Keegan Carroll]], who perfectly embodies the socially awkward boy torn between disappearing into the background and summoning the courage to convince his parents to buy him his dream gift.

As someone whose parents made watching A Christmas Story an annual tradition, I’ve seen the movie over 30 times and know the dialogue by heart. Yet, Alhambra’s production surprised me and made the story feel brand new! Its innovative set design, video projections, creative lighting and choreography breathed fresh life into a familiar classic.

One standout moment was Ralphie’s vivid imagination, where he envisions his life transformed by the coveted Red Ryder carbine-action, 200-shot, range-model air rifle with a compass in the stock and “this thing that tells time.” The “Ralphie to the Rescue” sequence was a knee-slapping, rip-roaring delight that stayed with me long after the curtain closed. With its dazzling lighting effects, extravagant costumes and over-the-top performances, this number was as much fun for the cast as it was for the audience.

Mrs. Shields, played by [[person:Nikki Spies]], stole the show with her tongue-in-cheek portrayal of a schoolteacher turned gangster moll. Her theatrical delivery and captivating musical number left the audience spellbound!

At its core, A Christmas Story is about a little boy whose greatest mission in life is to acquire a Red Ryder BB gun. But after getting it, Ralphie realizes the gun won’t bring the grand adventure he imagined. Instead, he discovers the true magic of Christmas lies in the love and chaos of his quirky, supportive family — eating Peking duck together after their disastrous Christmas dinner.

One beautiful divergence from the movie is the musical number "Before the Old Man Comes Home," which explores the fractured relationship between Mom and Dad. After a heated argument, both storm out, leaving their sons to nervously attempt to repair the shattered “major award” leg lamp. The tender bond between young Ralphie and Randy in this scene is deeply touching as they try to fix the lamp, believing it mirrors their parents’ fractured marriage.

In the end, Mom and Dad reconcile in a heartwarming moment that brings the family closer than ever — something the movie lacks. Ralphie’s Red Ryder BB gun becomes all the more meaningful because it’s a gift from his father, symbolizing their unspoken bond.

Alhambra’s [[production:2024 A Christmas Story: The Musical]] is more than a nostalgic adaptation — it’s a heartwarming, fresh and utterly delightful production that amplifies everything we love about the original story while adding new depth and emotional resonance. It’s the perfect way to celebrate the season, and I highly recommend making this show a new holiday tradition for your family!
