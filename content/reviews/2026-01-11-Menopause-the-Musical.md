Grab your fan, shapewear and TUMS — [[production:2026 Menopause The Musical]] opened Friday night at the [[theatre:Alhambra Theatre]] in Jacksonville, Florida. Created in 2001 by Jeanie Linders in Orlando, Florida, *Menopause the Musical* has since become the longest-running musical production in Las Vegas history. A show created with Baby Boomers in mind, it puts a humorous spin on the traditional jukebox musical genre.

The story begins with four women who connect while shopping at Bloomingdale’s, bonding as they navigate “The Change.” Lyrics from popular songs of the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s are cleverly rewritten to reflect the realities of these four women as they experience this new stage of life. In fact, the show kicks off with a parody of Aretha Franklin’s “Chain of Fools,” reimagined as “Change of Life,” where granny panties play a prominent role in the choreography.

*Menopause the Musical* is not plot-heavy; in fact, the four women at its center aren’t even given traditional character names. Instead, they are identified by archetypes: Professional Woman, portrayed by [[person:Millicent Penny Sylvester|Millicent “Penny” Sylvester]]; Soap Star, brought to life by [[person:Cathy Merkel-Roddy]]; Earth Mother, embodied by [[person:Lisa Valdini Booth]]; and Iowa Housewife, portrayed by [[person:Dina Barone]].

Songs and conversations unfold everywhere from the shopping floor to the restroom — sometimes even inside a bathroom stall — underscoring that no topic is considered off-limits. The set design features Art Deco–style arched doorways painted in black, white and daffodil yellow, effectively suggesting a Bloomingdale’s department store in New York City. Costume changes and set pieces are kept to a minimum, allowing the focus to remain on the performers and the props used to heighten each number.

Tissues become the object of choice during Lisa Valdini Booth’s rendition of “Drippin’ and Droppin’,” set to the tune of “Wishing and Hoping,” as she dabs her chest and forehead while shimmying across the stage. I have long been a fan of Lisa Valdini Booth, so I was thrilled to see her take on one of the lead roles as Earth Mother. All four women are highly entertaining and delightful.

Iowa Housewife (Dina Barone) delivers some of the show’s best one-liners, paired with strong physical comedy. When Soap Star laments, “I used to be a size 2,” Iowa Housewife dryly fires back, “So did my right leg,” earning guffaws from the crowd.

Professional Woman (Millicent “Penny” Sylvester) also stands out vocally, particularly when she struts onstage in a Tina Turner–inspired costume. Her performance is filled with energy and passion that would make the Queen of Rock and Roll smile. Unfortunately, something seemed amiss with the sound mix during what should have been her powerhouse number, as her vocals didn’t project as strongly as expected. This was not an isolated issue; throughout the show, the audio often felt subdued.

Lighting design shines during Soap Star’s number “Hot Flash,” as Cathy Merkel-Roddy slinks across the stage. The set is suddenly bathed in a warm crimson glow, punctuated by blinking lights that evoke a sultry tropical nightclub. Merkel-Roddy presses herself against the wall, crooning about the sudden heat flash overtaking her. Her strong physicality allows her to convey her character’s turmoil and desire through movement and dance.

Given the overtly female-centered subject matter, I initially wondered how invested or entertained the men in the audience might be. I needn’t have worried. They were smiling just as wide — and laughing just as hard — especially when the topic of mood swings surfaced. It was also refreshing to see a production that centers women well beyond their twenties.

One song in particular seemed universally relatable for women of nearly any age: “Babe,” in which the characters confront the reality that, despite being fully grown adults, their mothers still treat them as if they were eight years old.

Is Menopause the Musical for everyone? Probably not. However, if jokes centered on hot flashes, night sweats, brain fog and mood swings feel relatable, then you are very much its target audience. Menopause the Musical is a silly, lighthearted escape that allows audiences to leave their worldly worries behind for an evening.

It is also refreshing to see a production shine a spotlight on topics many women face that are still considered taboo. Perhaps, in its own small way, this comedy might even spark broader conversations — or inspire further scientific research into the female body, an area that has historically been underrepresented. By the final number, the four women fully embrace “the change,” discovering not only how to cope, but how to feel empowered through friendship and shared experience.
