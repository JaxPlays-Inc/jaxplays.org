I was spellbound the moment I heard that [[theatre:Theatre Jacksonville]] was performing [[production:2025 Dracula: A Comedy of Terrors]], and was drawn to opening night in a slow, hypnotic trance.<!--more-->

As a passionate fan of *[[w:What We Do in the Shadows (TV series)|What We Do in the Shadows]]* and *[[w:Renfield_(film)|Renfield]]*, I find that Theatre Jacksonville does not disappoint with its laugh-a-minute, “loosely based on the novel Dracula” production. I shouldn’t be surprised — Theatre Jacksonville has long maintained an excellent reputation for its comedic Shakespearean plays. *Dracula: A Comedy of Terrors* is the latest feather in its cap… or wooden stake in its belt.

The story begins with neurotic, germaphobic Harker, played by [[person:Christopher Watson]], on a treacherous journey to Romania to visit Count Dracula. Any play that pays homage to Monty Python and the Holy Grail in the opening scene is destined for greatness. Harker soon meets Dracula, who is in the market for a new home. He’s interested in a three-bedroom, two-bath — complete with a tall blonde in possession of a beautiful neck. Unfortunately, the lady with the beautiful neck is none other than Harker’s fiancée Lucy, elegantly played by [[person:Katie Johnston]].

Harker tries to dissuade Dracula from purchasing the dilapidated dump known as Withering Manor, ominously located just down the lane from Lucy’s home. He protests its many revolting attributes: “What about the mold? And the bugs?” Unruffled, Dracula dryly replies, “I’m used to it… I have a timeshare in Florida.”

Comedic timing and a wildly creative use of props make this production absolutely bewitching. I’m thoroughly convinced the smoke machine was invented solely to announce the alluring, dramatic entrance of [[person:Jordan Born]]’s Dracula. Born commands the stage with a sensual, dangerous intensity, stalking his prey like a predator with purpose. He leaves his victims tittering on the edge of seduction, exuding the sleek, lethal grace of a leopard ready to pounce.

Born is the only actor in the show who does not play dual roles. The actors’ innovative character shifts delight the audience — even more so when puppet versions of their counterparts are introduced. I’m completely embarrassed to admit I don’t even realize that [[person:Rachel Johns]] plays both the amorously airheaded Mina and the forcefully Germanic Dr. Van Helsing. Between the costumes, makeup and transformation of body language, Johns would make Frau Blücher proud. The entire cast pulls its weight, and I cheer every time [[person:Emily Johns]]’ Renfield pops in to make an appearance. Don’t tell the rest of the cast, but Renfield is my favorite.

While the set design is minimal — three stone arches flanked by Ionic columns — the costumes are lusciously designed in cool earth tones and evoke the late 1860s time period. The lighting design is outstanding, skillfully defining invisible boundaries on stage and heightening the campy disco moments for Dracula. The sound design includes delightful Easter eggs. At first, I thought the audio isn’t quite loud enough, until I realized the cast isn’t microphoned. I’m thoroughly impressed by their ability to project consistently throughout the performance.

I love [[production:2025 Dracula: A Comedy of Terrors]]. If you're craving a hilarious and bloody good time, fly to Theatre Jacksonville and sink your teeth into this one before it vanishes into the night.
