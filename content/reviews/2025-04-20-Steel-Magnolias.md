[[production:2025 Steel Magnolias]] at [[theatre:Orange Park Community Theatre]] invites audiences into the warm, familiar hum of a Southern beauty salon where hairspray is as essential as heart. Over the course of several years — and across changing seasons, hairstyles and life stages — six women gather to share gossip, swap advice and support one another through life’s joys and devastations. Set entirely in Truvy’s salon, the play chronicles the wit, warmth and resilience of its characters as they navigate friendship, family and loss.<!--more-->

Director [[person:Cindy Baker]] leans into the natural intimacy of the script, crafting a production that feels less like theater and more like eavesdropping on real life. The salon setting is beautifully realized, with wigs and products that look plucked straight from the 1980s, grounding the show in both time and place. The design elements — particularly [[person:Barbra Wells]]’ costume choices, including Shelby’s pink sweater and high-waisted jeans — act as nostalgic visual anchors throughout the production. The space feels lived-in and familiar, drawing the audience into its rhythms so fully that we feel like flies on the wall. At times, cast members appear to speak directly to the audience — but they’re addressing the salon’s unseen mirrors, a clever staging choice that enhances the realism and keeps us immersed in their world.

The story begins with Truvy and Annelle, played by [[person:Kelly Weaver]] and [[person:Phaedra Smith]], whose characters shape the heart and rhythm of the salon. Truvy, the ever-optimistic stylist with a heart as big as her hairspray can, sets the tone with her steady presence and sharp Southern charm. Annelle, her timid new assistant, enters the story as an outsider, allowing the audience to learn the salon’s rhythms and relationships through her wide-eyed perspective. 

One of the production’s most impressive accomplishments is how seamlessly Weaver and Smith handle the styling work at the center of their characters’ world. Their movements behind the salon chairs — from parting hair to fluffing curls — feel so natural and practiced that it's easy to forget they aren’t professional stylists. Without the use of actual water or products, the illusion never breaks. It’s a testament not only to their commitment, but to the behind-the-scenes work of beauty consultant Rose Costantino, whose training brought realism to every wash, curl and precisely pulled strand from a highlight cap.

[[person:Ashlyn Brown]] is radiant as Shelby Eatenton, bringing confidence and quiet strength to every moment. She captures Shelby’s charm and determination with natural ease, making the character feel fully lived-in. Her portrayal of Shelby's diabetic seizure is especially affecting — a moment executed with precision and restraint that’s both physically convincing and emotionally wrenching. Brown never overplays the moment; instead, she leans into its realism, allowing the emotion to land with heartbreaking clarity.

Opposite her, [[person:Izzy Hague]] delivers a deeply grounded performance as M’Lynn Eatenton, balancing warmth, wit and quiet resolve with remarkable nuance. From her first entrance, Hague creates a sense of lived-in familiarity — a mother who’s loving but firm, and whose every glance and gesture reveals layers of unspoken care. Her emotional arc builds with quiet intensity, culminating in a final scene that is both raw and controlled. Together, Hague and Brown bring a layered authenticity to the mother-daughter relationship, making their bond feel both personal and profoundly real.

Dry, grounded and effortlessly funny, [[person:Ellen Hare]]’s Clairee offers a needed contrast to the show’s more emotional moments. With sharp timing and understated delivery, she lightens the tone without ever undercutting it. Clairee is more than comic relief — she’s a quiet anchor in the group, steady and supportive. Crashing into scenes with righteous fury and eccentric flair, [[person:Denise Fernandez]] brings a delightful intensity to Ouiser. Her performance walks a fine line between absurdity and sincerity, making Ouiser’s softer moments all the more affecting. Together, Hare and Fernandez round out the ensemble with humor and heart, showing how even the loudest personalities have a place in this circle of care.

The only notable stumble in the production comes during the scene transitions, which are noticeably slow and momentarily interrupt the show’s momentum. These pauses are understandable, allowing time for essential costume changes and set adjustments, and the single crew member handling the reset does so with care and efficiency. Still, the extended blackouts feel at odds with the pacing of the performance. With either more creative staging choices or additional backstage volunteers — ideally both — the production could explore smoother, more engaging transitions that better maintain the show’s rhythm. It’s a minor shortcoming in an otherwise heartfelt and well-executed production.

Brimming with warmth, humor and emotional depth, [[production:2025 Steel Magnolias]] at [[theatre:Orange Park Community Theatre]] offers a tender and resonant look at love, loss and captures the spirit of enduring friendship. With powerful performances, thoughtful design and a strong emotional core, it’s a beautiful showcase of Northeast Florida’s theater community — and a reminder of the quiet power that can live inside one small, unforgettable salon in Louisiana.
