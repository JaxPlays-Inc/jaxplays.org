Greenlight Theatre Company's *Cabaret* centers on the burlesque theatre called the Kit Kat Club in 1930s Berlin, Germany, where American novelist Cliff Bradshaw meets and falls in love with the excentric cabaret singer Sally Bowles, as the shadow of Nazism begins to fall over the city.

*Cabaret* at the John McManus Mainstage Theatre transports audiences straight into the heart of the Kit Kat Club. VIP tables adorned with low-lit lamps, champagne bottles and glasses along the front rows create a vibrant, club-like atmosphere, perfectly capturing the era's essence. With this immersive setup, the audience feels swept into the the events of *Cabaret* rather than just watching it.

The set design is a fascinating blend of simplicity and complexity. Walls adorned with headlines from historical newspapers and magazines create a multidimensional space that brings the story's context to life. LED lights, cleverly integrated within fabric-lined inner rims of the walls, shift hues to match the on-stage action, effectively enhancing the mood and dynamics of each scene.

Catherine Tetzlaff's portrayal of Sally Bowles is stunning. She seamlessly blends raw emotion with dazzling energy, capturing Sally's vulnerability and vivaciousness. Her vocal and emotional depth are most notable in the title song, 'Cabaret.' Tetzlaff ebbs and flows through anger, sadness and defiance, infusing the song with profound emotional resonance, making her interpretation of 'Cabaret' the reviewer's new all-time favorite.

Jonathan Crawford absolutely shines as the Emcee, exuding a magnetic blend of charisma and flair. Crawford, a phenomenal triple threat, captivates with a riveting performance, drawing the audience deeper into the club's provocative world. His stage presence and audience interaction inject the show with vital energy, and his dancing is exceptionally crisp and animated.

Jack Davis' portrayal of Cliff Bradshaw is nuanced and compelling. He navigates Cliff's journey with a grounded sincerity, offering a strong counterbalance to the more flamboyant characters. Brenda Schoenfeld, as Fraulein Schneider, delivers a heartfelt and convincing performance, capturing the character's resilience and warmth. Her physicality and body language are so authentic that she convincingly becomes an elderly woman, despite her real age.

Bob O'Hara's Herr Schultz is endearing and poignant, bringing a touching sense of hope and tragedy to the role. Austin Kelley and Lisa Ciardulli, as Ernst Ludwig and Fraulein Kost respectively, deliver solid performances that add depth and texture to the supporting cast.

The Kit Kat Girls and Kit Kat Booys ensembles bring an incredible amount of fun and excitement to the show. Their dancing is consistently on point, displaying remarkable precision and coordination. Any rare lapses in synchronicity seem to be intentional character choices, adding a layer of realism and complexity to their performances.

Incorporating live instrumental music by cast members was a bold and successful choice. Assata Davis on violin, along with Hailey Wilson and Thain Day on saxophones, infused scenes with a raw, authentic sound that elevates the production. This decision adds an extra layer of excitement and realism, seamlessly blending the musical's narrative with live music.

Greenlight Theatre Company's *Cabaret* is absolutely entertaining and excels in its musical presentation, demonstrating the utmost importance placed on music. Unfortunately, the production did suffer from some audio issues that occasionally detracted from the experience. Director Chris Milligan highlighted during the curtain speech that Greenlight is currently fundraising for new microphones, a much-needed upgrade to ensure that the cast's outstanding performances are fully appreciated.

Greenlight Theatre Company's *Cabaret* is a special production that skillfully combines immersive staging, stellar dance routines and exceptional vocal performances to create an unforgettable experience. The musical's script, which tackles the rise of authoritarianism and racism, is especially poignant today. This production serves as a potent reminder of the ever-present dangers of these forces and the importance of standing against them.
