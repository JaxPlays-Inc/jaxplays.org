In homage to mid-century black-and-white suspenseful horror flicks that elicit more groans than actual ghouls, [Act II Players](/theatres/act-ii-players/) presents [*Beware the House on Haunted Hill!*](/productions/2024-beware-the-house-on-haunted-hill/)

As the script says, ‘good artists borrow, great artists steal.’ Remember the original film with Vincent Price, or the 1990s remake starring Geoffrey Rush? This production is like those, but more earnest. By that I mean Earnest goes to the House on Haunted Hill — campy and fun, with more dead jokes than dad jokes alongside a few modest jump scares and creepy cameos.<!--more-->

In this adaptation of the classic 1959 film, four strangers are invited to spend a night in an abandoned mansion on Haunted Hill by eccentric film producer Frederick Loren on behalf of his unknowing but completely suspecting wife, Annabelle.

Overseen by the traumatized Wilhelmina Pritchard, the caretakers serve dual roles as background spooks and purveyors of sound effects. They lock in the party guests: Dr. David Trent, the psychiatrist to the stars; Ruth Bridgers, a recently demoted gossip columnist; Lance Schroeder, a star of stage and screen; and Professor Nora Manning, a renowned paranormal expert. Each of these characters is resolved to spend the night and earn the offered prize, despite the apparent danger.

The bi-level stage draws the audience in and makes them a part of the action, while the period music and handy newsletter (milk was less than a dollar a gallon!) set the ambiance beyond simple stage dressing. It was easy to watch the split action without becoming distracted from the dialogue and plot, both of which are solid and self-aware, and the expanded set allows for greater movement than other productions at the same venue. 

Under the guidance of directors Brent and Penny Mulberry (and without giving away too much detail), the cast makes sublime use of practical effects including physical props and mood lighting. I would have loved some additional musical cues like discordant organ notes or sudden strings, as certain scenes became suddenly silent. Overall, the production maintains the rhythm and cadence of the original film, while a few cleverly placed tongue-in-cheek references remind the audience just how far we’ve come as a society – or not, in some cases.

I was surprised to find any scenery standing once Alisa Tillman got through chewing on it, and I mean that as a sincere compliment; her rendition of the usually mild-mannered ‘straight man’ Pritchard was reminiscent of *Pirates of the Caribbean*’s spooky spiritual guide Tia Dalma - much deserving of applause. Natalie Primm nails her part as the salty journalist, playing as much off her fellow cast members as her increasingly intoxicated role. Eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren, played here by David Primm, evokes Vincent Price with a dash of sincerity underneath an otherwise stoic performance, the perfect foil to Natalie Brown’s over-the-top, confident Annabelle. Mark Rubens' performance as Dr. David Trent may invoke ‘hysteria’ as prescribed, while Austin Burney's *not*-Nora Manning carries much of the action and dialogue with absolute aplomb (if looks could kill, her stare would be well suited for the job). Jacob Unger’s turn as slightly-concussed himbo actor Lance stole much of the show via facepalms and audible laughter. As the kid next to me in the audience said, 'give him some credit – he has TWO concussions!'

This kooky romp through the world of comedy-horror is a delight for all ages, with the real prize being the laughs we had along the way.
