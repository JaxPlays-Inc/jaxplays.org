Theatre Jacksonville's latest offering, "Just Desserts: A Musical Bake-Off," whisks audiences away to the kitschy world of a local baking competition, rife with colorful characters vying for the sweet taste of victory.

In the heart of a quirky small-town fair, a ragtag group of amateur bakers, each with their own sprinkle of idiosyncrasies, vie for the top prize. As personalities clash and flour flies, the contestants must find the right mixture of skill and collaboration to rise to the occasion, all while serving up laughs and slices of drama.

The stage, a cleverly crafted homage to low-budget community access television productions, sets the scene with its charmingly rudimentary design of plywood and paint that surprisingly elevates the authenticity of the setting.

Mimicking the well-loved format of "The Great British Bake-Off," with a dash of game show pizzazz, "Just Desserts" presents its own take on the sweet alchemy of reality television, complete with a cast of characters as colorful as a patisserie window.

In this confectionery contest, Blake Michael Osner, as our host, Zack, perfectly captures the facade of a small-town weatherman who, despite the glamorous tuxedo and camera-ready smile, is fatigued by his own shtick.

Aly Blakewell, as Brandy, bubbles over with enthusiasm, infusing the stage with her larger-than-life presence and her family drama, equally larger-than-life. Rachel Johns imbues Emma with such a commanding presence that if she isn't meant to be the protagonist, it's a well-kept secret from her. Hayley Smith as Jean masterfully stirs up a whirlwind of emotions, inducing anxiety and empathy in equal measure.

Richie Rosado's Donny seizes the spotlight effortlessly, his dynamic performance commanding attention from his very first step on stage. Matt Barnes' portrayal of Lou is heartwarming and replete with an endearing charm that's undeniably crowd-pleasing, even if he didn't quite nail the Brooklyn accent. Amy Allen Farmer, as Mildred, dominates the stage with a voice so powerful and fraught with emotion, it left the audience in an exquisite state of heartache during her solo.

The choreography by Theresa Pazanowski brought a cohesive rhythm to the stage, her skillful direction of the actors' movements creating a synchronized elegance that breathed life into the scenes and gave the production dynamic energy.

Under Erin Barnes' adept musical direction, the ensemble's numbers were not only striking but also showcased a beautifully balanced harmony that underscored the group's collective talent.

As much as the cast and crew delivered a delightful performance, the musical itself has a bit of a soggy bottom. The script and lyrics seemed underdeveloped, lacking the complexity and nuance that create a memorable theatrical experience. Similarly, the music, despite moments of charm, generally didn't manage to captivate or resonate with the audience, feeling somewhat uninspired. The whole composition bears the hallmarks of an underbaked pastryâ€”edible but certainly not golden brown, leaving one wishing they had been left in the creative oven a bit longer for a richer flavor. 

In the hands of a lesser cast and creative team, "Just Desserts" might have crumbled under the weight of its serviceable, yet unremarkable source material; however, this ensemble rose to the occasion, serving up a performance as rich and satisfying as the most decadent of desserts.

As Prue might say, this production is "definitely worth the calories."
