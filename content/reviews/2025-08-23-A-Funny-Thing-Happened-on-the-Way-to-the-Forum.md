With a cast featuring many of Jacksonville’s brightest stars and Tony Award winner [[person:Cady Huffman]], [[theatre:Theatre Jacksonville]]’s [[production:2025 A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum In Concert]] lights up the [[venue:Florida Theatre]].

It’s a riotous evening, flat-out hilarious from start to finish. The show brims with farce, wordplay and physical comedy, while at the same time leaning on stereotypes and blatant misogyny that on their face could feel cringy in 2025. What makes it work is how much it laughs at itself. The over-the-top characters, absurd situations and sheer ridiculousness turn the punchlines back on the men and the world they’ve built. That self-awareness keeps the comedy sharp and the audience firmly in on the joke.

The ensemble is strong across the board, but a few performances rise to another level. [[person:Neal Thorburn]] as Hysterium steals every scene he touches, layering nervous energy, crisp comedic timing and an impeccable sense of rhythm that keeps the audience hanging on each frazzled outburst. [[person:Alec Hadden]]’s Miles Gloriosus is another standout — his booming voice and commanding stage presence make Miles both ridiculous and terrifying, a parody of pompous masculinity that lands every time he strides across the stage. Both actors elevate the night with performances that feel fully realized, even within the pared-down concert setting.

Other performances shine in their own right. [[person:Andy Moritz]] and [[person:Sarah Boone]] play Senex and Domina with a playful balance of bluster and sharp wit, while [[person:Brennan Moritz]] and [[person:Morgan Perry]] bring sweetness and charm to Hero and Philia. [[person:C. Michael Porter]]’s Erronius has an endearing haplessness, and [[person:Josh Waller]] gives Lycus a smarmy edge that feels perfectly at home in the world of *Forum*. The courtesans — [[person:Rebecca Turngren]] (Tintinabula), [[person:Emma Griffes]] (Panacea), [[person:Kailey Anderson]] and [[person:McCall Camp]] (The Geminae), [[person:Theresa Pazanowski]] (Vibrata) and [[person:Lee Hamby]] (Gymnasia) — add flair to the evening, rounding out the musical’s world of chaos with vibrant personality, each finding ways to make their brief moments memorable.

[[person:Cady Huffman]] brings undeniable charisma to Pseudolus. When fully in the moment, her performance sparkles with wit and a sense of mischief that fits the role beautifully. But her dependence on the script and score at times dulls the spark. In an in-concert format, use of the script is fully expected, but Huffman’s near-constant reliance on it gives sections the feel of a first table read rather than a polished performance. The difference is striking — when she sets the book aside, she is magnetic, but too often the energy sags under the weight of the page. The inconsistency doesn’t erase her talent, but it does undercut what might have been a show-stealing turn.

The 21-member orchestra, under the direction of conductor and musical director [[person:Joey Chancey]], fills the vast volume of the [[venue:Florida Theatre]] with a spectrum of sound rarely heard even on most Broadway tours. From the brassy fanfares to the delicate woodwinds, every note resonates with clarity and power. This orchestra doesn’t just accompany the performers, it elevates the entire experience, transforming the concert into something unlike any other theater event in Northeast Florida. Chancey’s leadership ensures the music is as sharp, alive and commanding as the comedy on stage.

As a whole, [[production:2025 A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum|Forum In Concert]] is a night of big laughs, bold performances and a sweeping musical presence that sets a new standard for what local theater can achieve. It captures the spirit of the classic while letting Jacksonville’s brightest talents shine, proving that even in concert form this farce still has the power to bring down the house. For Jacksonville, it is a triumph — a reminder of the city’s rich talent and the power of collaboration between the [[venue:Florida Theatre]] and [[theatre:Theatre Jacksonville]]. Building on the success of last year’s [[production:2024 Mame In Concert]], this production shows the promise of concert-style theater in Jacksonville. If this is any indication, audiences can look forward to more events of this caliber in the future, each promising to deliver something extraordinary and uniquely memorable to Northeast Florida’s theater scene.
