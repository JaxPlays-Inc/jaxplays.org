At [[theatre:Limelight Theatre]], *[[production:2024 9 to 5: The Musical|9 to 5: The Musical]]* offers a toe-tapping, delightful romp through the highs and lows of office life in the late '70s. This spirited adaptation of the 1980s hit film, with music and lyrics by the iconic Dolly Parton, follows three office workers as they enact a wild plan to kidnap their "sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot" of a boss and run the company themselves, leading to unexpected hilarity and heart.

At first glance, the stage features a seemingly, relatively flat, painted plywood city skyline with cutouts of individual skyscrapers. However, this backdrop is remarkably innovative, with various set pieces ingeniously hidden within the skyline. With just a pull and a turn, parts of the cityscape transform into a restroom, a bedroom or an office, adding layers of visual surprise. 

The show is anchored by the trio of Sherrie Provence, Emily Layt and Megan Rodriguez who bring to life the vibrant and spirited trio of Violet, Judy and Doralee, characters originally portrayed by Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton in the film. The trio's chemistry is infectious and their harmonies, especially on "I Just Might," are a delight to the ears.

Sherry Provence captures Violet's dual essence of might and fatigue with exquisite finesse. Even though she is worn thin by life’s relentless demands of her, Provence's performance expertly weaves exhaustion with unyielding resolve. Her delightful solo on "One of the Boys" is a defining moment for Violet, as she sheds the shackles of misogyny and takes her rightful place as a leading force in her workplace.

Emily Layt's Judy is irresistibly endearing, her initial terror and palpable naivety laid bare for all to see. As Judy's journey unfolds, Layt masterfully transitions her character, gradually peeling back layers of fear and insecurity until reaching a crest of confidence, culminating in a powerhouse solo in “Get Out and Stay Out.” 

Megan Rodriguez as Doralee is a revelation on stage. She embodies Doralee with a voice that’s both nostalgic and novel. Her voice, phenomenal in its clarity and richness, evokes the best of 1980s country music but with a twist that’s all her own. Instead of merely imitating Dolly Parton, Rodriguez offers something beautifully unique, that pays homage to the original without being derivative. Her performance could easily belong in the best of Nashville’s music scene. Rodriguez's portrayal is emotionally charged, perfectly capturing the pain of being misunderstood and judged solely on her appearance, allowing the audience to truly empathize with her emotional journey.

Jad Jordan's portrayal of the contemptible Frank is delightfully repulsive, capturing the essence of a character you love to hate. His rendition of "I'm Here For You" is a highlight, combining a perfectly hideous demeanor with comedic brilliance. The harmonies in this number are impeccably delivered, underscoring the humor with a musical precision that leaves the audience both laughing and cringing at his loathsome charm. Jordan's performance is a masterclass in how to be deliciously disgusting, making Frank a memorable, albeit revolting, spectacle on stage.

Lacey Cataleta delivers a stellar performance as Roz. As the quintessential henchman and foil to the lead trio's schemes, Cataleta brings an exceptional dynamic to her character arc. In "Heart to Hart," she masterfully transitions Roz from a mild and meager office worker to a fiery siren, unleashing a performance that is both astoundingly hilarious and irresistibly bold. Her knack for physical comedy shines, turning every gesture and movement into a moment of pure comedic gold.

Mitchell Wohl's Joe is a charming and endearing addition to the cast. His duet with Violet on "Let Love Grow" is a heartwarming moment with sweet harmonies. Wohl's performance is a perfect balance of sincerity and humor, adding depth to the show's romantic subplot. 

Stephanie Riner's choreography is crafted with a fun and intricate style that keeps the audience captivated from start to finish. Riner shines in the way she blends classic and contemporary moves, creating sequences that are not only visually engaging but also enhance the storytelling. 

Meanwhile, Jonny O'Leary direction is so fluid that it's hard to distinguish where his blocking ends and Riner’s choreography begins. This blurring of lines ensures that the movement on stage feels completely integrated with the narrative, enhancing the dynamic flow of the entire show and making the direction as much a part of the story as the script itself. 

Brilliantly, the stage crew is also dressed in '70s office attire, making each set change feel like an integral part of the office hustle. Several set transitions occur while the lead singer is still performing, adding a sense of urgency and excitement to the show. This thoughtful touch enhances the immersive experience, blurring the lines between performance and reality and keeping the audience engaged in the constant motion of the workplace drama. 

David Paul Rowan’s musical direction is particularly stellar, with his guiding hand shining brightly on key numbers like the opening and finale renditions of "Nine to Five," as well as "Joy to the Girls," "Shine Like the Sun," and "Change It." His ability to draw out robust harmonies and maintain a strong balance across all sections adds a rich, full sound that elevates each song. 

*9 to 5: The Musical* offers a vibrant and engaging portrayal of empowerment through its clever use of humor and a catchy, toe-tapping score. Limelight Theatre's production brilliantly brings this to life with a talented cast and crew who deliver passionate performances, resulting in an entirely sold-out run of regular shows. 

However, there are still a few tickets available for the benefit performance on August 3rd at 7:30 PM, with proceeds going to support Catholic Charities St. Augustine's financial & food assistance programs. Those [tickets are still available at the time of publishing](https://one.bidpal.net/ccbtheatre2024/ticketing).
