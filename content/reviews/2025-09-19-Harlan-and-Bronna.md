In its dazzling world premiere at [[theatre:Lumen Repertory Theatre]], [[production:2025 Harlan and Bronna Jump Out the Window]] proves itself to be a wildly funny, thought-provoking and utterly original theatrical experience. Written and directed by [[person:Michael Jacobs]], the play takes the familiar story of the wealthy elite brought low by their own excess and reinvents it as a fast-moving, absurdist romp layered with bite and brilliance.<!--more-->

The play follows a fabulously self-absorbed Upper East Side couple whose gilded world collapses when their fortune evaporates. Faced with the unthinkable — living like “them down there” — Harlan and Bronna cling to cocktails, couture and increasingly outrageous schemes to preserve their sense of importance. Alongside their long-suffering business manager Kale, they spiral through parties, park benches and surreal encounters with strangers, searching for meaning in a world that refuses to play by their rules. The result is an absurdist comedy of decline that’s equal parts biting satire and laugh-out-loud entertainment, yet manages to be unexpectedly wholesome.

Jacobs brings impressive pedigree to this premiere. With Broadway credits (*Cheaters*, *[[w:Impressionism_(play)|Impressionism]]*) and television successes ranging from *[[w:Boy Meets World]]* and *[[w:My Two Dads]]* to *[[w:Dinosaurs_(TV_series)|Dinosaurs]]* and the Emmy-nominated *[[w:Girl Meets World]]*, he has long proven his gift for blending sharp comedy with heart. That craft is fully on display here. *Harlan and Bronna Jump Out the Window* carries the polish of a master storyteller who makes audiences laugh while quietly slipping in moments of genuine poignancy.

The production embraces the surreal with stagehands drifting through scenes, lights shifting on a whim, and a radio that laces apocalyptic headlines with jaunty Leon Redbone tunes. Yet for all its absurdist devices, the experience is never alienating. It’s playful, unpredictable and constantly engaging — a fever dream that stays sharp and inviting. Come for pure entertainment and you’ll laugh until your cheeks hurt; look deeper and you’ll leave with ideas to wrestle long after the curtain falls.

Part of the play’s strength is the way it invites interpretation without ever demanding it. Jacobs hints at multiple layers of meaning, allowing audiences to choose whether to take the story at face value or to lean into its more surreal possibilities. Either way, it lands with impact.

[[person:James Tucker]]’s lighting design is subtle yet brilliant, grounding each scene with a clear sense of place even as the world around the characters seems to spin out of control. [[person:Brian Niece]]’s always-impressive sound design expands the stage into a full soundscape, pulling the audience deeper into the play’s strange, collapsing reality.

The pacing is impeccable. The show moves quickly without ever feeling rushed, and the comedic timing lands with precision every time. [[person:Jeff Drushal]] and [[person:Karen Konzen]] are pitch-perfect as Harlan and Bronna, two spoiled, self-absorbed monsters you can’t help but adore. Drushal leans into Harlan’s man-child bluster while Konzen slices through scenes with acid wit and magnetic poise. Their chemistry crackles, carrying the play with a mix of brittleness and affection, insufferability and irresistible charm.

[[person:Bill Ratliff]] brings warmth to Kale, the exasperated business manager who watches helplessly as his clients unravel. [[person:Grace Bryan]] provides unexpected pathos as Amelia in a brief but affecting turn, while [[person:Josh Andrews]], as the Stage Manager, embodies the play’s meta-theatrical edge, reminding us at every turn that this is both life and performance. Young [[person:Flynn Linning]] delights as Oliver, a bright symbol of innocence and legacy that Harlan and Bronna can’t quite hold onto.

Jacobs’ direction embraces the chaos while keeping the energy buoyant. The show never feels heavy, even when it veers into darker reflections on wealth, consumption and legacy. The production is funny, biting and surprisingly tender, shifting from satire to sincerity with disarming ease. It’s black comedy with a cabaret beat — a satire that makes you laugh while it quietly pierces your heart.

At Lumen Rep, [[production:2025 Harlan and Bronna Jump Out the Window]] is a triumph: wickedly funny, brilliantly performed and layered with meaning. It’s the rare premiere that feels instantly like a classic.
