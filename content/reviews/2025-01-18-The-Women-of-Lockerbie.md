[[theatre:Theatre Jacksonville]]’s production of [[production:2025 The Women of Lockerbie]], directed by [[person:Jeff Grove]], delivers a poignant and deeply human exploration of grief and resilience that intertwines personal loss and collective mourning against a visually stunning backdrop. With a carefully curated cast and a set that feels as alive as the characters themselves, this production creates an immersive, emotionally resonant experience.<!--more-->

*The Women of Lockerbie*, written by Deborah Brevoort, is a powerful fictional drama inspired by true events. Set seven years after the tragic bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, the play follows grieving American parents Madeline and Bill Livingston as they travel to the Scottish hills in search of closure for their son’s death. There, they encounter a group of local women determined to reclaim the clothing of the victims from the U.S. government and return it to the families as an act of healing. Blending Greek tragedy-inspired structure with a deeply human story, the play explores themes of grief, forgiveness and the enduring strength of community in the face of unimaginable loss.

[[person:Johnny Pettegrew]]’s set and lighting design transforms the stage into the rolling hills of Lockerbie. The stepped hills, seemingly merging with the abstract projections of rolling fog and twinkling stars, create a hauntingly beautiful Scottish landscape. The lighting imbues the stage with a cool, dew-covered atmosphere, perfectly setting the tone of the play’s themes of mourning and hope. The river weaving through the set, evoked through lights and water effects, adds a visceral fluidity to the scenes, while transitions from night to sunrise are mesmerizing in their quiet power.

At the heart of the production is Madeline Livingston, portrayed by [[person:Evie Day]], whose emotional depth and raw vulnerability are unforgettable. Her monologue, drenched in grief and self-blame, is gut-wrenching, revealing layers of pain that feel all too real. Equally moving is [[person:Taylor Smith]] as Bill Livingston, whose heartbreaking collapse near the end of the play is so achingly real that it blurs the line between actor and character.

[[person:Grace Bryan]] commands attention as Olive Allison, bringing a fierce determination to the role while conveying the empathy and endurance of the Lockerbie women. [[person:Cathy Maxwell Finke]] as Hattie offers a grounded, warm, humorous and rebellious counterbalance. [[person:Greg Hewitt]] portrays George Jones with a palpable sense of impatience and detachment, capturing the character’s desire to complete his duty and move on to a more prestigious position in the State Department. Hewitt effectively conveys Jones’s frustration with the emotional weight of the situation, emphasizing his discomfort and focus on efficiency over empathy.

The production’s attention to detail is exceptional. The candle props flicker with lifelike warmth, while the well-worn wool coats capture a rugged practicality — thick and heavy enough to ward off the cold, yet never quite stopping the drafts, subtly evoking the unrelenting chill of the Scottish hills. A leather trifold wallet, complete with faded photographs, instantly anchors the story in the 1980s. Each element of the props and costumes subtly enriches the narrative, immersing the audience in the time and place.

Grove’s direction ensures that each moment feels intentional, from the measured pacing of dialogue to the emotional crescendo of the final scenes. The result is a production that does not force sentimentality but allows it to emerge naturally through authentic performances and thoughtful design.

[[theatre:Theatre Jacksonville]]’s [[production:2025 The Women of Lockerbie]] is a beautifully crafted production that explores profound themes with grace and precision. The combination of evocative visuals, authentic performances and careful attention to detail makes it a standout theatrical experience.
