In the eerie, backwoods town of Hope Falls, West Virginia, an unsettling discovery is made — a boy with bat-like features and feral instincts — is found in a desolate cave. \[[production:Bat Boy: The Musical]] at \[[theatre:ABET - All Beaches Experimental Theatre|ABET]] confronts the tensions between humanity and monstrosity in a darkly comedic satire that examines the terrifying power of fear and ignorance. As the townsfolk wrestle with their primal instincts to shun what they do not understand, the musical delves into themes of identity, belonging, and the often catastrophic consequences of unchecked prejudice. Laden with wit and irony, this production juxtaposes light-hearted musical numbers with deeply resonant social commentary, creating an experience that is equal parts disturbing and thought-provoking.

Ethan Edward Fisher brings Bat Boy to life with a performance that is both physically dynamic and emotionally nuanced, capturing the character’s desperation and vulnerability with remarkable finesse. Fisher’s portrayal is distinguished by his impressive physicality, especially in "Show You a Thing or Two," where he masterfully blends theatrical exuberance with an adorable sense of innocence, making Bat Boy’s journey of self-discovery both compelling and heartfelt. Despite the significant challenge of singing and speaking through the character’s exaggerated, fang-like teeth, Fisher’s vocal performance remains impressively clear and powerful, highlighting his exceptional range and control. His ability to navigate these physical and vocal challenges while maintaining the emotional core of Bat Boy’s character is a true testament to his talent and commitment.
