The FSCJ Artist Series presented the non-Equity tour of [[production:2024 Dear Evan Hansen]] for a one-night-only performance on November 3, 2024. This production, a staple of modern musical theater, is brought to life by a talented cast led by Michael Fabisch as Evan Hansen. The performance captures the emotional core of the story — an exploration of isolation, truth and belonging that resonates deeply with today’s audiences.

Michael Fabisch delivers an emotionally honest and nuanced portrayal of Evan, adeptly navigating the character’s complexities. His vocal performance, especially in "Waving Through a Window," is moving, capturing Evan's yearning and vulnerability. Fabisch’s ability to embody Evan's internal conflicts creates a relatable and layered performance that anchors the show.

Hatty Ryan King as Zoe Murphy brings both grace and resilience to the role, portraying Zoe’s journey from grief to tentative acceptance with subtlety and strength. Her chemistry with Fabisch is authentic, adding depth to their interactions. King’s vocals complement Fabisch’s well, especially in their duet "Only Us," where she balances tenderness with emotional clarity.

Bre Cade gives a compelling performance as Heidi Hansen, embodying the character’s struggles as a single mother trying to connect with her son. Her portrayal was surprisingly tragic and heartwarming, capturing the essence of a parent grappling with life’s challenges and the desire to protect their child. Cade’s rendition of "So Big/So Small" is a highlight, bringing palpable emotion to the stage as she captures Heidi’s love and exhaustion.

Caitlin Sams and Jeff Brooks as Cynthia and Larry Murphy, respectively, round out the Murphy family with performances that convey the complexities of parental grief and confusion. Sams’ portrayal of Cynthia is heart-wrenching, while Brooks brings gravitas and a sense of restraint to Larry.

Gabriel Vernon Nunag as Jared Kleinman provides much-needed comic relief, delivering his lines with sharp timing and wit. Nunag’s portrayal adds levity without undercutting the show’s darker themes. Meanwhile, Makena Jackson brings vibrant energy to the role of Alana Beck, effectively conveying her character's desire to make a difference, even if sometimes misguidedly.

Alex Pharo as Connor Murphy captures the intensity of a misunderstood teenager, lingering as a haunting presence throughout the show. Pharo’s ability to switch between Connor’s anger in life and his symbolic role in Evan’s journey adds complexity to the production and his few moments of pure physical comedy is absolutely perfect.

The set and lighting design help convey the digital age’s influence on relationships, with screens and projections reflecting social media’s pervasive role in the story. The use of digital elements feels immersive and contemporary, enhancing the sense of a world in which isolation often exists behind screens. The lighting choices effectively underscore the emotional arc, contrasting Evan’s lonely isolation with moments of warmth and connection.

Overall, *Dear Evan Hansen* is a thoughtfully executed and powerful rendition, thanks to standout performances and effective staging. This production of *Dear Evan Hansen* succeeds in bringing fresh talent to one of today’s most relevant and stirring musicals. The show grapples with timely themes — mental health, loneliness and the search for connection — with sensitivity. Although limited to a single performance, before they have to pack it all up and go to another city, the cast brings notable depth and empathy to their roles, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.

While fans who have seen the show on Broadway or even the recent Equity tour that ended in July 2023 may find this production slightly less polished, the cast’s commitment to the material and the emotional resonance of the story remain intact. For fans of the musical that have yet to see it live, [this tour](https://www.dehtour.com/tour) is a can't-miss opportunity to experience the emotional journey of *Dear Evan Hansen*. Unfortunately, the next closest stops on the tour are in Columbus and Athens, Georgia, so if you missed it in Jacksonville, you may have to travel a bit to catch it.
