Lauren Gunderson’s [[production: 2024 The Revolutionists]] unfolds at [[theatre:Players by the Sea]] as a vibrant, audacious exploration of sisterhood, revolution and the power of storytelling. Set against the turmoil of the French Revolution, this play weaves a fictional narrative around three real historical figures — playwright Olympe de Gouges, assassin Charlotte Corday, and the infamous Marie Antoinette — and a fourth character, Marianne Angelle, a fictional embodiment of the free Black women who were pivotal in the revolutionary movements of Saint-Domingue, present-day Haiti. Though their paths never crossed in reality, Gunderson brings them together in this bold, meta-theatrical drama, filled with modern language and self-referential wit. The production delves into themes of female empowerment and artistic expression, offering a fresh lens through which to view history.

[[person:Jennifer Lilly]] takes on the role of Olympe de Gouges, the ambitious playwright at the heart of the narrative. Lilly’s portrayal is commanding yet grounded, with a sharp comedic edge reminiscent of subdued [[w:Jennifer Coolidge]] — combined with a hint of [[w:Jenny Slate]]'s Mona Lisa. Her presence is marked by a gold, metallic dress with a defined bust, a costume choice that underscores Olympe's blend of glamor and gravitas. Lilly’s Olympe is the quintessential playwright within a play, bringing a self-aware energy and self-deprecating tone that highlights the script’s clever use of meta-theatrical commentary.

[[person:Ayviana Singh]] delivers a mesmerizing performance as Marianne Angelle, the story's moral anchor. Singh imbues the character with a rich tapestry of emotions and an undeniable presence that elevates every scene she graces. Singh commands the stage with a poise that feels both timeless and profoundly human. Her portrayal is a masterclass in acting — elegant yet forceful, tender yet unyielding, compassionate yet authoritative. Her ability to navigate the nuances of Marianne’s journey — from fierce revolutionary to empathetic confidante — speaks to a level of skill that is absolutely extraordinary. The contrast she creates with Olympe’s comedic energy grounds the narrative and enriches it, anchoring the story in a truth that resonates deeply with the audience. Singh's extraordinary talent shines through in this role, hinting at the recognition and accolades that lie ahead in what promises to be her illustrious career.

Her stance is resolute, signifying her readiness to commit a daring act that could change the course of history in 'The Revolutionists.'" attr="Mike Kitaif" attrlink="" >}}
[[person:Morgan Williams]] storms onto the stage as Charlotte Corday, embodying the radical assassin with an exuberance that demands attention. Charlotte's entrance is loud and unabashed, her character draped in a flowy, white, southern belle-inspired dress that juxtaposes her violent intentions. Williams captures Charlotte’s youthful fervor and ideological passion, bringing an energy that disrupts and enlivens the play’s dynamic.

Marie Antoinette, portrayed by [[person:Catie Casey]], is a scene-stealer in every sense. Casey’s Marie is decked out in an over-the-top pink corset and a massive hoop dress, and delivers her lines with a hyperactive Minnie Mouse voice infused with an Effie Trinket-like flair. Casey's Marie is absolutely hysterical, delightful, larger-than-life and completely absurd. Every line she delivers is absolutely hilarious... until there's nothing to laugh about any more. Just before the play’s conclusion, Marie evolves, shedding her ridiculous facade to reveal an unexpected and profound depth, wisdom and genuine kindness. While the transformation speaks to the brilliance of the script, it’s Casey’s impressive range and nuanced delivery that makes it unforgettable.

[[person:Jillianne Tamillo]]’s direction cleverly amplifies the meta-theatrical aspects of the script, with moments like Olympe’s self-aware line, "I call it meta theatre," hanging a lampshade on the play’s nature. The production constantly teases the breaking of the fourth wall, more like "gently tapping" it before finally boldly walking through it, providing a powerful, emotional moment that resonates with the audience.

The technical aspects of the production are executed with precision. Scene transitions are notably smooth, with cast members left on stage in darkness as the action shifts to the upper stage, maintaining a fluidity that keeps the audience engaged. The use of lighting cues is exceptional, enhancing the emotional tone of each scene and punctuating the play’s dramatic and comedic beats. A standout moment comes with the first execution scene, followed by a song that is both brilliant and beautiful, amplified by the incredible acoustics. A gut-wrenching scream that follows in a later scene is literally breathtaking, a haunting sound that lingers in the air long after it has been uttered.

*The Revolutionists* is experimental theatre at its best, a play that does not shy away from questioning itself and its medium. *The Revolutionists* leaves the audience yearning to learn more about these remarkable women and their real-life counterparts, achieving something that a straightforward historical narrative might not. By blending humor, emotion and modern sensibilities, the play humanizes these figures in a way that makes us fall in love with them and eager to delve into their stories. As Amber Hollister aptly described, it felt as though the entire play took place in a "cosmic, liminal ladies' room" — a space where all women, regardless of their backgrounds or destinies, might cross paths and help each other before stepping back into their tumultuous lives. This setting offers a unique lens through which to view these characters, not just as historical figures, but as relatable, complex women whose experiences transcend time. Olympe’s journey, whether she is ever truly alone on stage or surrounded by these larger-than-life figures, reflects the broader struggle of women to assert their voices in a world that often seeks to silence them.

*The Revolutionists* at Players by the Sea is a thrilling blend of humor, history and heart. It reminds us of the enduring power of art to challenge, to disrupt and ultimately, to revolutionize.
