The FSCJ Artist Series presentation of [[production:2025 Les Misérables]] is a visual spectacle the likes of which I have never seen. At times, I sat slack-jawed in disbelief, staring at the living painting before me. The harmonious fluidity of set changes, lighting and actors hitting their marks is like a cyclone — ripping through the stage, tearing things apart, only to magnetically reassemble into something new.<!--more-->

It shouldn’t surprise me. Since its West End debut in 1985, Les Misérables breaks ground in myriad ways, particularly with its revolutionary use of a revolving stage. This production stays true to that legacy.

Powerhouse vocalist Nick Cartell, as Jean Valjean, brings an emotional depth that spans the character’s 20-year journey. Opposite him, David T. Walker portrays Inspector Javert with an unhinged obsession that makes him the perfect foil to Cartell’s Valjean.

Much praise goes to the stage managers, technicians, lighting designer, costume crew, set designer and all those behind the scenes. The manic flurry of changes appears seamless despite the intricately packed storyline. The atmospheric backdrops, often paired with golden-hued lighting, evoke the works of the Dutch Masters. I’m thrilled to learn that the backdrops draw inspiration from author Victor Hugo’s own paintings!

At three hours, the show is dense, and every word is sung. It opens with a chilling rumble of voices chanting, “Look down, look down,” accompanied by the synchronized clanking of metal chains. From that moment, it grips you.

You enjoy *Les Misérables* even more if you familiarize yourself with the story beforehand. The plot follows Jean Valjean, who, after serving 19 grueling years for stealing a loaf of bread, finally gains parole. Inspector Javert warns him against returning to crime, but Valjean soon finds himself struggling in a world that refuses to forgive his past. When a compassionate bishop offers him shelter, Valjean betrays his trust by stealing silver. Caught by the constables, he returns to the bishop, who shockingly covers for him and even gives him more silver, urging him to use it for good. Overwhelmed, Valjean has a transformative moment:

"What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night! Become a dog on the run!... Yet why did I allow this man to touch my soul and teach me love? He treated me like any other. He gave me his trust. He called me Brother."

Determined to start anew, Valjean breaks parole and goes into hiding. Years later, he owns a factory where a young woman, Fantine, is fired after her coworkers discover she has an illegitimate child. Falling into destitution and illness, she turns to prostitution. When Valjean finds her dying of tuberculosis, he is wracked with guilt and vows to care for her daughter, Cosette.

While the story is heavy, moments of levity break up the tension. The raucous "Master of the House" number, performed by the mischievous Innkeeper and his wife, is an absolute showstopper and an earworm that sticks with you for days.

At its core, [[production:2025 Les Misérables]] tells a story of forgiveness — a theme that is both timeless and universal. It explores not only the act of forgiving others but also the difficult journey of forgiving oneself. Beyond personal redemption, the story also carries a powerful message about change and progress. It highlights the desire to build a better world — not just for oneself, but for future generations. While the tale is undeniably tragic, hope lingers in the end. Though the “Children of the Barricade” fall in their fight for justice, their sacrifice paves the way for a stronger, more compassionate France that begins to acknowledge and support its citizens.
