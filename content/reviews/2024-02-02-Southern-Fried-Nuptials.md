This February, the [Act II Players](/theatres/act-ii-players) walk us down the aisle to meet the sequel to *Southern Fried Funeral*, *Southern Fried Nuptials*, a heartfelt comedy of familial errors in judgment, timing, and identity.
<!--more-->
Southern belle and bedlam magnet, Harlene Frye, is soon-to-be-wed to charming and considerate Atticus (Atty) Van Leer — that is, if she can overcome her increasingly cold feet. Sister Sammy Jo and husband Beecham argue over when to reveal their upcoming move to Florida to the rest of their Mississippi family. When he's not absorbed in games on his phone or dealing with peanut butter in his hair, younger brother Dewey Jr. is persistently underfoot, but clearly the favorite of matriarch Dorothy, still grieving the loss of her husband and trying to keep her spinning family somewhat on track. Family friends — and long forgotten foes — provide additional flavor and foils that threaten to derail this already postponed event.

Haven’t seen *Southern Fried Funeral*? Fear not; references to characters and previous plot points abound but won’t slap you in the face with a full backstory. The genuine suspense comes as a pleasant surprise, and the cast works cohesively to breathe life into an otherwise obvious storyline with occasionally overly verbose dialogue. While the exposition can feel as though it drags just a hair too long at times, towards the end of each scene and act, the action and verbal sparring crescendo into a cacophony that puts on full display the finely tuned balancing act of cast and crew — well worth the wait.

Accents are abundant, though they are more Southern-flavored than Southern fried; everything from Cajun to Texan twang can be heard across the cast, elongating four-letter words into four-syllabic drawls with a charm that says “Bless their hearts.” Director Michael Skaff plays to his cast’s strengths and allows their interpretations to shine in this ode to the modern, modified Southern family. The story and character development take center stage amid a simple yet impressive set.

Bride-to-be Harlene Frye is fraught with insecurities in character, but not in Tori Tompkin’s genuine performance. Greg Hewitt enters — and remains — as the voice of reason in an impressive performance as fiancé Atticus, while Natalie Primm commands the ensemble masterfully as matron Dorothy Frye; her delivery and heartfelt emotion behind her lines captivate. David Primm’s deadpan delivery as pickle magnate Vaster Pickens was a delight, particularly when juxtaposed with the over-the-top kookiness of Ralin Trosclair’s Fairy June (her rambling stories had the audience in stitches). 

Megan Castillo and Josh Rutgers absolutely nail Sammy Jo and Beecham’s supportive but combative couple dynamic, while Jade Bevis’ plays Dewey Jr for laughs with a natural ease that belies his years. Martha Ann and Ozella Meeks – played by Marilyn Painter and Maureen Chandler Reid, respectively — are instantly recognizable as the two ladies who continually gossip to, with, and about you at Sunday service. Alan Painter’s portrayal of Harlene’s honky-tonk ex-hunk Carter Canfield rounds out the cast providing a conspiring, charming villain. 

This swamp-bred symphony of silliness is served with a surprisingly sentimental slice of honesty and understanding among family. Now that’s something y’all can really enjoy.
