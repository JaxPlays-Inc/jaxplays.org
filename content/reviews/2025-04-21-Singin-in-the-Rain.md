*Singin’ in the Rain* has entertained audiences since 1952 with a universal story that still resonates 72 years later: the fear of advancing technology stealing our jobs. The message may be sandwiched between snappy dance numbers, but it’s there. Change is coming. Adapt and innovate — or get left behind. [[theatre:Amelia Community Theatre]] in Fernandina Beach recently brought the beloved classic [[production:2025 Singin’ in the Rain]] to life on stage.

The plot revolves around silent film heavyweights Lockwood and Lamont as they debut their latest movie, *The Royal Rascal*. The parade of movie stars, bedecked in sparkling 1920s costumes, is a spectacle as they strut and pose on the red carpet for their adoring fans and paparazzi. Amelia Community Theatre cleverly showcased *The Royal Rascal* to the audience via a video screen mounted above the stage. The over-the-top acting and humorous title cards delighted the audience — and the timing couldn’t be more apropos, given the recent opening of Jacksonville’s own historic silent film museum, Norman Studios.

We’re introduced to leading man Don Lockwood and his longtime friend, music composer Cosmo Brown — played by real-life brothers [[person:Sebastian Miller|Sebastian]] and [[person:Elliot Miller]] — as well as America’s favorite sassy sweetheart, Lina Lamont. Actress [[person:Renée LaCroix]]’s Lina is bold, brassy and channels Miss Piggy’s attitude in the absolute best way. To call her merely a “scene-stealer” would be a disservice to her magnetic talent.

The silent film trio finds themselves in a bind after the first “talkie,” *The Jazz Singer*, makes its world-shattering debut, sending shockwaves through the silent film industry. The message is clear: add talking — or face bankruptcy and obsolescence. This isn’t a problem for Don and Cosmo, who both have a robust background in vaudeville. Regrettably for them — and their studio — Lina Lamont sounds like Eliza Doolittle’s Brooklynite cousin. Cosmo laments about Lamont, “Lina. She can't act, she can't sing, she can't dance. A triple threat.”

As Don mulls over his predicament, he stumbles upon Very-Serious-Actress Kathy Seldon, played with wholesome spunk by [[person:Julia Taylor]]. She dismisses Don’s films as “seen one, seen ’em all,” and loftily proclaims she only performs “REAL theatre.” Though Don’s ego has been knocked down a peg, he can’t shake thoughts of the beautiful — albeit self-righteous — Kathy. Their paths cross again when he finds her working as a humble chorus girl at Monumental Studios. Determined to get even, Don tosses a jab about her theatrical hypocrisy. Kathy’s heated response? A thrown cream pie.

Unfortunately, poor Lina Lamont becomes the unintended victim of this drive-by pie assault.

The show is full of musical numbers you know and love, such as "Singin’ in the Rain" and "Good Morning". The choreography during "Singin’ in the Rain" was joyous and uplifting, as a kaleidoscope of rainbow-colored umbrellas twirled amongst the dancing ensemble. I couldn’t stop tapping my feet during the show-stopping "Good Morning" number — the infectious energy was elevated even further by the performers’ expertly tailored costumes.

Even aging starlet Lina Lamont had her time to shine with the solo "What’s Wrong with Me?" LaCroix’s portrayal of Lina was far more sympathetic than her film counterpart. After all, Lina just wants to keep her job, keep her man and banish the hussy who slapped her in the face with a pie. Can you blame her? She laments, “It's dog-eat-dog! Vultures waiting to eat your carcass before you're even dead.”

There was a multitude to love about Amelia Community Theatre’s production. The costumes were lavish, tailored and truly Broadway-caliber — made all the more impressive given the sheer number of costume changes required for the epic dance numbers. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the sets. Much of the scenery consisted of sloppily painted rectangles the color of mud or childlike renderings of buildings reminiscent of elementary school plays.

The elegantly crafted costumes, when juxtaposed against such gauche backdrops, was a slap in the face. It really pulled you out of the moment — *beauty and the cringe*. Even repainting the panels black with gold filigree trim, would have greatly improved the sets.

Not all the acting or singing talent was even, but that’s something to be expected in community theatre. I was especially impressed to learn that the Miller brothers had no prior dance experience before rehearsals began! Cosmo’s number, "Make ’Em Laugh", was as full of vigor as it was with pratfalls!

I believe families of all ages will love it. *Singin’ in the Rain* reminds us that while change — especially in the face of new technology — can be daunting, it also opens the door to creativity, reinvention and joy. Amelia Community Theatre captured that message with charm and flair — proving that when you embrace change and dance through the unknown, the results can be truly magical.
