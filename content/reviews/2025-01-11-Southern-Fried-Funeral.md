The [[theatre:Alhambra Theatre & Dining]] production of [[production:2025 Southern Fried Funeral]] is a deliciously funny and heartfelt exploration of family dynamics, Southern charm and small-town life.

The story begins with the sudden death of Dewey Frye, a larger-than-life family patriarch whose passing sends the Frye family into a whirlwind of emotions, conflicts and unexpected revelations. At the center of the chaos is Dorothy Frye ([[person:Peg Pachal]]), the backbone and matriarch of the family. Pachal portrays Dorothy with a perfect balance of confidence, strength and vulnerability, making her the glue that holds the story together. Dorothy’s resilience in the face of grief feels authentic, showing how humor and strength can coexist even in the darkest times. In one particularly poignant scene, Dorothy sits at the kitchen table and speaks to an empty chair, as if Dewey were still there. Her words are filled with love, longing and the quiet heartbreak of someone adjusting to a new reality. Pachal’s ability to convey both the humor and the raw emotion of such moments anchors the show, giving it a heartwarming and deeply human core. Pachal's portrayal of Dorothy captures the essence of a Southern matriarch, blending warmth, tenacity and a touch of wit.

Dorothy is joined by her two daughters: the tightly wound and pragmatic Sammy Jo Frye-Lefette ([[person:Natalie Drake]]) and the free-spirited, slightly dramatic Harlene Frye ([[person:Logen Cheatham]]). Sammy Jo is relentless in her drive to keep things together, often using her sharp humor and no-nonsense demeanor to steer the family forward. Drake’s well-honed Mississippi accent, a clear product of dedicated study and careful effort, adds authenticity to her portrayal and grounds the character in the Southern setting. Cheathan imbues Harlene with a lovable loser quality. She is navigating her life with a mix of charm and exasperation that makes her immediately endearing. Drake and Cheatham play off each other beautifully, embodying the sisters' sibling rivalry with  tender — and bruised — love for each other. Their scenes together are some of the play’s highlights, filled with biting wit and moments of genuine connection, as they manage to balance their differences with an undercurrent of deep affection. 

Equally notable is Beecham Lefette ([[person:Calvin Bernardo]]), Sammy Jo’s steadfast and patient husband. He provides the perfect foil to Sammy Jo’s headstrong personality, bringing a calm and rational energy to their scenes. The chemistry between Bernardo and Drake is spectacular, making their scenes both funny and heartfelt. Beecham’s unwavering support, even when Sammy Jo barrels through situations with her determined attitude, creates a balance that highlights their strong, if imperfect, partnership.

Adding to the mix is Dewey Frye Jr. ([[person:Ryan Lemmon]]), the well-meaning and earnest son who adored his father but often finds himself out of step with the world around him. Lemmon’s portrayal of Dewey Jr. is impressively genuine, authentic and downright adorable without veering into caricature. He brings a sweetness to the role, capturing Dewey Jr.’s deep love for his dad and his quirky, nitwit charm. Lemmon’s performance avoids stereotypes and instead offers a layered portrayal that emphasizes Dewey Jr.'s authenticity and vulnerability, making him an easy audience favorite.

[[person:Thaddeus Walker]] is a relaxed and natural presence on stage as Atticus "Attie" Van Leer the longtime-friend of the family and Mississippi lawyer navigating the family’s legal troubles with a calm authority. His performance feels effortless, drawing the audience in with his authenticity. Walker’s portrayal gives the show a grounding element, balancing the larger-than-life characters with a steady and credible depiction of a lawyer who has likely seen his fair share of small-town drama.

Dub Frye ([[person:Tom Cassaro]]), Dewey’s self-serving brother, is a fantastic villain. Cassaro plays Dub with just the right amount of charm to mask his greed, making his betrayal sting even more. He pretends to care about the family while slowly digging his claws in, creating palpable tension in every scene. Cassaro’s ability to shift between feigned sincerity and underhanded scheming makes him a compelling antagonist, driving much of the show’s conflict and keeping the audience on edge whenever he’s on stage.

As the delightfully nosy and hilarious secondary antagonist Ozella Meeks, [[person:Brooks Anne Meierdierks]] is the standout performer of the show. Meierdierks steals every scene she’s in with her outrageous Southern drawl and pitch-perfect comedic timing. She’s equal parts irritating and irresistible, a true highlight of the production. Her larger-than-life personality injects humor into even the tensest moments, creating a comedic balance that keeps the audience laughing throughout. Ozella’s over-the-top meddling provides a counterpoint to the show’s more grounded emotional beats, making her an unforgettable character.

The production, directed by [[person:Tod Booth]], is a well-oiled machine, delivering impeccable comedic timing and emotionally resonant moments that ensure the audience is fully engaged from start to finish. Booth’s direction strikes the perfect balance between the show’s humor and its heartfelt core, making every joke land while giving the emotional moments room to breathe. Booth’s ability to orchestrate the chaos of a Southern family in turmoil while maintaining a clear narrative thread is a testament to his expertise in comedy and drama alike.

The excellent set design by [[person:David Dionne]] captures the essence of a Southern home, bringing the Frye family’s kitchen to vivid life. [[person:Patti Eyler]]'s thoughtful choices with working props like a functional refrigerator and mixer lend an almost cinematic realism to the stage, while [[person:Carly Meyer]]’s sound design enriched the atmosphere with subtle but effective touches that transported the audience to Mississippi. This attention to detail immerses viewers in the world of the Frye family, making every scene feel tangible and real. 

Southern Fried Funeral is a silly show with profound moments that could easily be missed in a lesser production. Alhambra’s version is a beautiful rollercoaster of emotions — hilarious, heartbreaking and heartwarming all at once. The audience was one of the most emotive seen in recent performances, with laughter, tears and audible gasps heard throughout the show. The ability of the cast and crew to evoke such a wide range of responses is a testament to their talent and dedication.

The [[theatre:Alhambra Theatre & Dining]] has assembled a dream cast, featuring some of the best actors in Jacksonville all on one stage. From the heartfelt performances to the clever staging and design, [[production:2025 Southern Fried Funeral]] is a theatrical feast that will leave you laughing, crying and maybe craving some fried chicken. Don’t miss this unforgettable celebration of Southern family life.
