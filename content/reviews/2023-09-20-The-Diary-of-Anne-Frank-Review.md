_The Diary of Anne Frank_ chronicles the true story of Anne Frank, a young Jewish girl who goes into hiding with her family during World War II to escape the Nazis. For two years, the Franks and several others live in the "[Secret Annex](https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/secret-annex/)" of an Amsterdam building. Anne's diary serves as a personal account of their lives, their hopes, and the oppressive environment in which they find themselves.

The simple, yet intricate set, designed by Ben Girvin, practically becomes its own character within the drama. Every creak and groan of the set resonates through the theater, lending an additional layer of tension to this poignant story. Packed with barely enough furniture for the tenants of the Annex, the stage feels chaotic and lived-in, without becoming overwhelmingly cluttered. The multiple layers give the set both dimension and depth, while simultaneously heightening the feeling of confinement experienced by the characters.

The costuming, curated by Classic Costumes, is equally remarkable. The attire feels as if it has been lifted directly from a 1940s closet, capturing the essence of the time period with impeccable detail. These authentically period-appropriate costumes transport the audience back in time.

Audrey Rivera as Anne Frank delivers a memorable performance. She perfectly encapsulates Anne's youthful optimism and infectious curiosity, juxtaposing it with moments of vulnerability. Rivera is ridiculously hopeful in the face of terror, embodying the indefatigable spirit that makes Anne a symbol of hope. Each of Rivera's monologues is like a tug on a tightly wound thread, propelling the story forward and keeping the audience engaged in Anne's unfolding story.

As the stalwart Mr. Otto Frank, Jas Abramowitz delivers a notably strong performance in the play's more dramatic scenes. He lends gravitas to the role and provides the audience with a real sense of the terror faced by a father in unimaginable circumstances. His portrayal is particularly effective when the stakes are highest, adding depth to these intense moments.

Jacob Dinkel's portrayal of Peter Van Daan is spot-on, flawlessly capturing the essence of an awkward teenager. His tone and body language embody the "lone wolf" persona perfectly. In his scenes with Anne, particularly during their "date," Dinkel masterfully captures a blend of endearing awkwardness and genuine affection offering moments of lightness. Yet, these seemingly simple interactions also take on a bittersweet tone, serving as haunting reminders of the young characters' impending tragic fate.

Zoe Carpenter's Margot Frank is both subtle and impactful, offering a nuanced portrayal of the more mature, yet often annoyed, older sister. She serves as a stark contrast to Anne, but her role is equally important in capturing the complex dynamics of the family.

Cecilia Cristol, in her role as Mrs. Edith Frank, is a vivid portrayal of a mother on the brink. She encapsulates the sheer exasperation of trying to maintain control in a situation that defies it. The climax of human conflict that unfolds before the play's end is especially poignant in her performance, as Cristol masterfully conveys the toll the unbearable circumstances take on her character's grip on humanity.

The characters of Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan, skillfully portrayed by Evan Gould and Evie Day, serve as complex emotional foils to the Frank family. Their bickering and fighting are charged with palpable fear and anger stemming from their desperate circumstances. Evie Day captivates the audience as Mrs. Van Daan, consistently commanding attention with her magnetic presence. Evan Gould holds his own as Mr. Van Daan, not only matching Day's scene-stealing prowess but also navigating a range of emotions—from frustration and anger to moments of sharp, witty sarcasm and depths of shame—all with precise comedic timing and heartfelt sincerity.

Michael Skaff's portrayal of Mr. Jan Dussell starts off as a character filled with weakness, fear, and exhaustion, yet filled with immense gratitude for the sanctuary provided. As the play progresses, Skaff's Dussell transitions into a figure who becomes adorably annoying, adding layers of complexity to the role. His portrayal offers moments of levity, serving as a brief respite in an otherwise somber and emotionally charged narrative.

Jason Collins' sensitive and evocative direction expertly utilizes the stage to create an atmosphere of both intimacy and entrapment, capturing the essence of the characters' confined reality. Additionally, the music and sound design are impeccably mixed, lending the entire performance a cinematic undertone that perfectly complements its pacing.

The production is an emotional roller coaster, capturing the highs of moments like Hanukkah and the news of D-Day, as well as the lows of gut-wrenching terror and the looming threat of discovery. The depiction of their eventual capture by the Nazis is stark and haunting, etching itself into the memory of the audience long after the final bow.

What makes this experience even more poignant is the sobering reminder that these events are not merely scripted drama, but the harrowing real-life experiences of the characters portrayed. The unique impact of live theatre comes into sharp focus when conveying real tragedies. Being in the same room with the actors as they channel these intense emotions adds an irreplaceable depth to the experience, offering an emotional resonance that can't be matched by books or movies.

Amid a distressing resurgence of white supremacy and antisemitism, this riveting play at Theatre Jacksonville underscores the vital need for empathy and compassion and the peril of letting hatred go unchallenged. Theatre Jacksonville deserves commendation for not only taking on such a challenging production but executing it with the gravity and respect it demands.
