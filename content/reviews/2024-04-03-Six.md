*Six* burst onto the stage Tuesday night at the Jacksonville Center for the Performing Arts, and instantly captivated Jacksonville's theater-goers. 

*Six* stands out for its incredibly original storytelling style, a departure from traditional musical theatre. Rather than transporting the audience to a distant realm, the characters — Henry VIII's six wives — take to the stage right here, right now, in Jacksonville, sharing their life stories through an unforgettable concert.<!--more--> The queens pick up their microphones and take command of the stage, embodying their roles as historical figures with a twist of power and humor, delivering dynamic performances across genres including pop, hip-hop, Latin pop, electro-house, and R&B. This diverse and energetic soundtrack not only engages the audience emotionally but also physically, with the entire audience on their feet and dancing by the end of the night.

Each queen brings her own unique flavor to the story, creating a true ensemble production that delights and moves. While the show's concept revolves around the queens vying to prove who suffered the most at the hands of Henry, each of the six deliver remarkable performances, with a few shining particularly bright. Amina Faye, in the role of Jane Seymour, delivers a rendition of "Heart of Stone" that is ethereally haunting and profoundly beautiful. With a demeanor that embodies a serene, quiet sorrow, Faye captivates the audience, drawing them into the depths of her character's pain and resilience. Her powerful voice, rich with emotion, weaves a spellbinding narrative that lingers long after the song ends.

Aline Mayagoitia's Katherine Howard is another standout, taking the audience on an emotional rollercoaster with "All You Wanna Do." Her narrative arc, from the highs of flirtation and empowerment to the lows of objectification and abuse, is delivered with a compelling intensity that grips the audience from start to finish.

The "Haus of Holbein" and Terica Marie's performance of "Get Down" offer lighter, yet equally engaging moments. The former serves as a delightful palate cleanser with its German house electronic vibes, while the latter, inspired by Nicki Minaj's hip-hop style, sets the audience alight with energy.

The visual spectacle of *Six* extends beyond its vibrant performances to its stunning costuming and innovative set design. The costumes, an audacious tapestry of pop star glam meets Tudor regalia, boldly toss historical accuracy out the window in favor of something far more fun and fantastical. This stylistic choice embraces the essence of the musical's contemporary retelling, marrying the spectacle of pop culture with a nod to the Tudor period in a way that's visually captivating and unabashedly imaginative.

Equally impressive is the set, which relies almost entirely on an elaborate lighting design that seems as though it was plucked from a parallel dimension where cathedrals where designed by stadium concert lighting directors. With an arsenal of moving lights and LEDs that display mesmerizing animations, the lighting is an ever-changing character in its own right. It dances in sync with every beat of the music, crafting a visual symphony that enhances the emotional impact of each song and brings the historical narrative into a dazzling contemporary light. This innovative approach to lighting and set design  complements the musical's storytelling and adds a layer of magic, making the audience's experience truly immersive.

However, *Six* is more than just a collection of powerful performances of catchy tunes with great costumes and lighting. It's a reclamation of voice and agency by six women who have historically been defined by their relationship to one man. This production, with its vibrant energy and innovative storytelling, does more than entertain; it invites reflection on how history is told and who gets to tell it.

*Six the Musical* is a must-see production that offers a refreshing and empowering take on a story centuries old. With its talented cast, innovative storytelling, and engaging musical numbers, it's a production that not only entertains but also inspires.
