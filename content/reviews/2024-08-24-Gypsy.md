*[[production: 2024 Gypsy|Gypsy]]*, the latest production at the [[theatre:Alhambra Theatre & Dining]], offers a compelling portrayal of ambition, sacrifice and the complex bond between a mother and her daughters. Set in the waning days of vaudeville and based on the true story of famed burlesque entertainer [[w:Gypsy Rose Lee]], the musical tells the story of her mother [[w:Rose Thompson Hovick|Rose Thompson Hovick]], a fiercely determined stage mother whose relentless drive for stardom propels her children, and herself, into the world of show business. The narrative unfolds with Rose's unwavering focus on making her youngest daughter, June, a star, even as it becomes increasingly clear that her dreams may be more about herself than her children.

At the heart of this production is [[person:Lisa Valdini Booth]], who embodies Rose with both intensity and nuance, portraying a woman whose iron will and manic energy push her to the brink. Her performance during "Rose's Turn," the climactic moment of the show, is both heart-wrenching and powerful, capturing Rose’s profound realization of why she has driven herself and her family so relentlessly. Booth’s Rose is not just a stage mother; she is the archetypal figure of unfulfilled dreams and desperate longing, making her journey as tragic as it is fascinating.

The story begins with the enchanting performances of [[person:Everly Doyle]] as Baby June and [[person:Delia Doyle]] as Baby Louise, who steal the audience’s hearts right from the start. Baby June is a ball of energy, her larger-than-life persona and voice packed into a tiny frame, absolutely captivating the audience with her boundless charm and exuberance. In contrast, Baby Louise is perfectly awkward, her quiet demeanor foreshadowing the transformation she will undergo later in the show.

As the story progresses, we see the children grow, and the pressures of Rose’s ambition begin to fracture the family. [[person:Logen Cheatham]]’s portrayal of Louise, the overlooked daughter who ultimately emerges as the star, is nothing short of spellbinding. Her metamorphosis during the iconic "Let Me Entertain You" is breathtaking, showcasing her journey from a timid, insecure girl into a confident, magnetic performer. Cheatham masterfully navigates this complex transition, capturing both the vulnerability and strength of Louise, who ultimately finds her voice in a world that has long ignored her.

[[person:Pete Clapsis]] delivers a warm and endearing performance as Herbie, Rose’s long-suffering partner, who brings a much-needed touch of humanity and compassion to the story. Clapsis’ Herbie is a gentle soul full of affability and sincerity. His portrayal makes Herbie’s eventual breakdown utterly gut-wrenching, as we see a man who has given so much of himself only to be left heartbroken.

The supporting cast shines as well, with standout performances from [[person:Torie DAlessandro|Torie D'Alessandro]] as June and [[person:Alexander Blanco]] as Tulsa. D'Alessandro’s June captures the conflict between love for her mother and the desire for her own life, and her duet with Cheatham on "If Momma Was Married" is a beautiful moment where both characters come into their own. Blanco’s Tulsa is a delight, his performance of "All I Need Is the Girl" bursting with charm and Danny Kaye-like charisma. The choreography and blocking in this number are particularly noteworthy, as they tell a rich narrative all on their own, adding depth and dynamism to the character’s aspirations.

[[person:Katie Nettle]]’s Miss Cratchitt, who also doubles as Tessie Tura, is another highlight, with her portrayal of Cratchitt feeling like she has stepped straight out of a classic film. Tessie Tura is brought to life with vibrant energy, and [[person:Kathy Sanders]]’ Mazeppa adds a delightful touch of humor with her over-the-top trumpet playing, hamming it up in the best possible way. [[person:Cathy Merkel-Roddy]] as Electra rounds out the trio of showgirls, each bringing their unique flair to the burlesque world.

The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, particularly in numbers like "Mr. Goldstone" and "Together Wherever We Go." The former’s clever blocking, which sees the characters playfully interacting with the various "stones" around the stage, is both entertaining and inventive, while the latter is a heartwarming testament to the resilience and unity of this makeshift family as they set out for new horizons.

The production reaches its emotional peak with Louise and Rose’s confrontation in the final act. Their relationship, marked by betrayal, love, disappointment and loyalty, is brought to life with such raw emotion that it resonates deeply with the audience. Rose’s final realization of her motivations in "Rose’s Turn" is a moment of catharsis, as she comes to grips with the true cost of her ambitions.

The production’s creative set design, utilizing projections to display neon and painted signs on the back wall, adds a layer of authenticity and nostalgia to the show, while also cleverly aiding in scene transitions. One particularly brilliant moment involves the flashing lights during a high-speed choreography sequence, seamlessly transitioning the audience from one scene to another, and the use of postcards to depict the journey from Seattle to Los Angeles is both effective and evocative.

The Alhambra Theatre & Dining’s *[[production: 2024 Gypsy|Gypsy]]* blends stellar performances, creative staging and a deep understanding of the show’s emotional core to create a theatrical triumph. It’s a production that honors the legacy of one of Broadway’s most iconic musicals while offering fresh, compelling interpretations of its characters and themes. Whether you're a fan of the classic or a newcomer to this timeless tale, this production is not to be missed.
