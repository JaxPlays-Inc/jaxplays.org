[[production:2025 Sense and Sensibility]], a play adaptation by [[w:Kate Hamill]] based on the 1811 novel by [[w:Jane Austen]], is a [[w:Regency era|Regency-era]] tale of family, womanhood and the delicate balance between logic and feeling. Hazel Robinson’s direction brings a dynamic theatrical take to this classic story and breathes new life into Austen’s world. Her vision preserves both the elegance of the society of the time and the emotional undercurrents of the characters, using movement, pacing and character dynamics to highlight the story’s timelessness.<!--more-->

The story follows two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, as they navigate society in financial hardship after their father’s passing. The play uses these characters to juxtapose the two core themes — and the show’s namesake — sense and sensibility. Marianne’s younger-sister whimsy and love-sick nature sharply contrast with Elinor’s practicality and restraint.

Angela Olsen, making her Northeast Florida stage debut as Elinor, delivers a strong performance. She remains honest in her portrayal of the straight-laced Elinor while subtly revealing the inner turmoil of a woman torn between duty and desire. [[person:Katie Timoney]] — a veteran of the Limelight stage — offers the perfect counterpart as Marianne, embracing her character’s dreaminess and impulsivity while also showing strength. Their time together on stage is magnetic, with timing, humor and energy that make the audience forget they are listening to 19th-century English.

The mastery of language is evident across the entire cast. The town’s Gossips serve as Greek chorus-like narrators, and from the opening scene, their clarity is essential in helping the audience follow Austen’s complex web of characters, relationships and social customs. Through strategic inflection and perfectly timed reactions, the narrators are not only helpful but engaging and energetic to watch.

The Gossips also assist in the many scene transitions. The set, designed to resemble the interior of a home, must frequently adapt to new locations. With each shift, furniture is moved and/or the Gossips announce the change. While the dialogue scenes unfold with excellent pacing, the prolonged and occasionally awkward transitions disrupt the show’s otherwise seamless rhythm. However, the set design by Donald Cupo — who also gives a stellar performance as Sir John Middleton — is whimsical and transportive. Costume design by Katie Timoney is equally impressive, capturing Regency-era rural England with beauty and historical flair.

Other strong performances include Cameron Hodges, who plays Edward Ferras, the story’s main heartthrob. Hodges mastered Edward’s awkwardness and charm in a way that had the audience on his side from the opening scene. In moments when Olsen, Timoney and Hodges were all on stage at the same time, their theatrical chemistry made it impossible to look away and had me begging for more.

Through the ups and downs of Elinor and Marianne’s personal lives, the strong supporting cast is able to sweep in and provide a laugh. A consistently hilarious and engaging performance was made by David Buchman as a household servant with an aptitude for gossip. In a similar vein, Don Cupo’s Sir John Middleton and Jen Harrow’s Mrs. Jennings had unforgettable performances that kept the audience smiling and laughing. 

[[production:2025 Sense and Sensibility]] at the [[theatre:Limelight Theatre]] is a not-to-miss play full of heartfelt family moments, a sweeping love story and a hilarious cast that will keep you laughing. Whether you’re a devout “Janeite” or new to her work, this production does honor to Austen’s novel and leaves a lasting impression.
