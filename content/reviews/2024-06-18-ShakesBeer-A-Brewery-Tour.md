*[[production:2024 ShakesBeer: A Brewery Tour|ShakesBeer: A Brewery Tour]]* returns with its unique blend of Shakespeare, interactive storytelling and brewery tour, creating a boisterous, booze-infused celebration of the Bard’s works. The talented ensemble of Jas Abramowitz, Josh Andrews, Rina Hajra-Gjoka, Katie Johnston, Amy Love, Nicole Maahs, Hayley Smith, Christopher Watson and Brian Niece, transforms local breweries into impromptu stages, delivering a show that is part theatre, part game show and entirely entertaining.<!--more-->

This innovative production reimagines Shakespearean performance by stripping away the conventional trappings of theatre—no sets, no costumes and barely any props. The result is a raw, performance-driven spectacle where the actors’ words and actions are the sole focus. Watching the cast fluidly transition between characters and scenes with just a cue is nothing short of remarkable, demonstrating their skill and versatility.

Audience engagement is a key component of ShakesBeer’s charm. The interactive elements, reminiscent of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" add a playful and spontaneous energy to the show. The audience’s participation, whether as spectators or active participants, enhances the communal, convivial atmosphere, making each performance unique. Furthermore, a beverage of your choice is included with your ticket, making the experience even more enjoyable.

However, this format, while loads of fun, sometimes feels like a double-edged sword. The game show elements, although entertaining, occasionally verge on the cheesy, resembling a corporate icebreaker more than a cohesive theatrical experience. Just as a scene begins to hit its stride, the show shifts gears, leaving the audience craving more depth and continuity in the performances.

Despite these minor quibbles, *[[production:2024 ShakesBeer: A Brewery Tour|ShakesBeer: A Brewery Tour]]* is a delightful, hilarious and engaging night out. It offers a fresh, accessible take on Shakespeare that even the most hesitant theatre-goer can enjoy. The laughter, the beer and the Bard blend together to create an evening that, while leaving you wanting more, guarantees a fantastic time.
