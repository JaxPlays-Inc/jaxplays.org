Set in New York City during the [[w:Northeast blackout of 1965|1965 Northeast blackout]], [[production:2025 Fly By Night]] follows Harold, a lonely sandwich maker grieving the loss of his mother, and the two sisters he meets by chance: Daphne, a wide-eyed aspiring actress, and Miriam, a quiet dreamer with an uncanny sense of premonition. As their lives intersect, the show explores how fate, love and loss shape their destinies in surprising and interconnected ways. Structured like a memory — looping, layered and lyrical — the musical finds meaning in small moments and unexpected connections.

Anchored by [[person:David Buchman]] as The Narrator, the show begins with a song that's as comforting and calming as a warm blanket, immediately drawing the audience into its quirky yet profound world. Buchman is undoubtedly the heart and soul of the production, expertly and seamlessly balancing humor and sincerity. He guides the narrative with an inviting warmth, keeping the audience laughing one moment and breaking their hearts the next.

[[person:Daniel Starling]] brings both vulnerability and quiet charm to the role of Harold McClam. His portrayal is thoughtful and grounded, capturing Harold’s confusion and longing as he navigates new relationships and lingering grief. Starling’s performance grows stronger as Harold’s world slowly expands, never losing the character’s aching sense of solitude.

[[person:Heather Starling]] (Daphne) and [[person:Amanda Pazos]] (Miriam) each bring thoughtful, grounded interpretations to their roles. Starling leans into Daphne’s hopeful drive and theatrical flair, while Pazos offers a more introspective counterweight as Miriam. Their performances are sincere and thoughtfully drawn, but the characters they inhabit often feel more static compared to the vitality and complexity brought to life by the rest of the cast. Still, their chemistry with Harold and with each other adds emotional resonance and credibility to the central love triangle.

As Harold’s father, Mr. McClam, [[person:Brian Johnson]] delivers one of the evening’s most emotionally affecting performances. With gentle precision, he brings dignity to a man haunted by regret and memory. 

[[person:Don Cupo]]’s turn as Mr. Crabble is a burst of comic energy in nearly every scene he appears in. He finds every possible laugh and delivers it with ease, without ever losing touch with the show’s deeper emotional stakes. [[person:Matthew Turnage]], as Joey Storm, adds a steady and natural presence to the ensemble, giving his scenes a sense of ease and likability that helps anchor the more chaotic moments around him.

One of the most inventive touches in this production is the unexpected use of practical water in the bathtub scene — a small but striking choice that really brings the moment to life. It’s a testament to the creative team’s attention to detail and willingness to take risks that pay off in unexpected ways.

Musically, the show finds its heartbeat in songs like "Circles in the Sand," which shifts effortlessly from playful to poignant. The folk-rock score is deeply tied to character and theme, reinforcing the show’s meditation on time, fate and the fragility of connection.

This production doesn’t rush to dazzle. It invites the audience to lean in, listen and piece things together — rewarding patience with moments of quiet beauty, unexpected humor and a slow-building sense of weight. *Fly By Night* doesn’t insist on being remembered. But in the stillness it leaves behind, it asks quietly to be felt.
