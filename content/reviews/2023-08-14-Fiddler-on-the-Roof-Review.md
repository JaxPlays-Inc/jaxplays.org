Any review of a show at The Alhambra Theatre & Dining must begin with a review of the food, because every dining experience is expertly paired to the production, and *Fiddler on the Roof* is no exception.

The dining experience at the Alhambra Theatre & Dining's production of *Fiddler on the Roof* sets the stage for a delightful evening. The lentil and vegetable soup comforts you with its warmth and richness, while the salad offers a refreshing contrast, being cool, bright, and tangy.

The slow-braised leg of lamb is robust in flavor, albeit a bit firm — not tough, but not exactly tender either. (It's almost exactly how I would expect the lamb to be served if I had dinner at Tevye's.) Contrastly, the couscous has a delightfully tender texture that dances on the tounge. The rosemary-infused sauce and al dente vegetables add layers of flavor, and the meal concludes with an apple crumb pie that's gently spiced and topped to perfection. Overall, the dining experience met and exceeded the reviewer's expectations, which served as an excellent appetizer to a remarkable evening.

On stage, Tod Booth's portrayal of Tevye is lovable and curt, with perfect comic timing. It's a rare occasion to experience an audience unleash such a thunderous roar of laughter—several times over. His rendition of "If I Were a Rich Man" was outstanding; he owned the stage and took the audience along for a joyous ride. His portrayal was passionate, especially when speaking of his faith and his love of his daughters. A standout moment occurs when Booth leads the family in the Sabbath dinner prayer. He effortlessly pivots from being a boisterous performer and storyteller to a reverent father, captivating the audience with the transition.

Lisa Valdini Booth's Golde is firm, strong, loving, and kind. Couples in the audience were seen holding hands and smiling at each other during her performance. Her chemistry with Tod Booth is palpable, and their duet of "Do You Love Me?" was a beautiful tearjerker. The pair encapsulate the complexities of marriage, weaving love, angst, irritation, and agony into their performances. Her acting is a masterclass, and her voice is a delight to hear.

The supporting cast was equally impressive. Patti Eyler's Yenta the matchmaker is a scene-stealer, delivering her lines with with impeccable comedic precision and a tone that adds a layer of humor and warmth to the community of Anatevka.

The daughters and their suitors bring a youthful energy and emotional depth to the production. Sarah Warshavsky's Tzeitel and Bear Manescalhi's Motel share an endearing awkwardness that captures the essence of first love, while Natalie Drake's Hodel and Alexander Blanco's Perchik exude a palpable tension and chemistry, embodying the spirit of change and revolution. Sofia Smith's Chava and Melvin Edward Nash II's Fyedka offer a nuanced portrayal of forbidden love, capturing the audience with their beautiful anxiousness and wonder. Each couple's unique dynamics contribute to the overarching themes of tradition, change, and the complexities of love, making their stories both individually compelling and integral to the show's emotional landscape.

Under the expert guidance of lighting designer Johnny Pettegrew, the lighting in the production was nothing short of flawless. His captivating design not only illuminated the stage but also added layers of depth and dimension to each scene, enhancing the emotional impact and visual appeal of the production. The lighting choices worked in harmony with the narrative, subtly guiding the audience's focus and elevating the overall experience.

The choreography, led by Shain Stroff and co-choreographer Erick Ariel Sureda, is a marvel of creativity and precision. Despite the constraints of a small stage, their choreography makes every movement feel expansive and full of life. The dance scenes are joyous and convincing, effectively communicating the tension between tradition and change. Stroff and Sureda have managed to utilize every square inch of the stage without making it feel crowded, a testament to their massive talent and ingenuity. Their work not only complements the story but also becomes a character in its own right, adding layers of meaning and excitement to the production.

While the production had a few incredibly minor hiccups—like the occasional audio static during "Anatefka," a *less-than-authentic* Rabbi's beard, and some audio issues with Motel's microphone—these did not detract from the overall experience. This production has earned a spot as one of my Alhambra favorites and it is easily one of the best performances I've enjoyed in Jacksonville. The emotional range, palpable character chemistry, and dynamic lighting design coalesce into an unforgettable experience. Moments like the Constable's reluctant bullying and the emotional rift between Tevye and Chava were deeply affecting, while the exuberant dance scenes were a sheer delight.

*Fiddler on the Roof* at the Alhambra Theatre & Dining is an unmissable production. The ensemble of a gifted cast, groundbreaking staging, and a delightful dining experience creates a memorable outing that both honors the original work and brings new layers of understanding and enjoyment. Whether you're a seasoned "Fiddler" or just finding your way to the roof, this production hits all the right notes.
