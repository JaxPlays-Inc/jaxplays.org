In the world of musical theatre, it's rare to find a production that invites its audience to simply sit back, relax, and enjoy a good laugh and a few drinks while being serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. [The Alhambra Theatre & Dining](/theatres/alhambra-theatre-and-dining/)'s latest offering, *Escape to Margaritaville*, does just that, enveloping its audience in a tropical paradise from the moment they step into the venue.

[*Escape to Margaritaville*](/productions/2024-escape-to-margaritaville/) is a musical getaway, woven with the iconic tunes of Jimmy Buffett, that transports its audience to a tropical paradise where the party never ends. <!--more-->The story unfolds on a small, idyllic island at a rundown resort where Tully, a laid-back bartender and singer, spends his days charming tourists with his musical talents and easygoing demeanor. His carefree world takes an unexpected turn with the arrival of Rachel, a workaholic environmental scientist who joins her friend Tammy's bachelorette party with a secret agenda: to collect soil samples for her research, prioritizing work over relaxation despite the festive backdrop. As their paths cross, Tully and Rachel embark on a journey of self-discovery and romance, challenging each other's worldviews and opening their hearts to new possibilities.

Surrounding them is a colorful ensemble of characters: Tammy, Rachel's best friend on a mission to enjoy her last days of single life; Brick, Tully's sidekick with a heart of gold; Marley, the wise owner of the resort who dispenses advice along with drinks; and J.D., an older pilot with a mysterious past and a treasure trove of island lore.

Crafted by sitcom writers, the narrative is rich with puns and bursts of hilarious comedic moments, seasoned with a hearty dash of risqué humor. Yet, the story navigates familiar waters, lazily steering through a predictable slew of clichés that highlight its lackluster, subpar script. Many of the songs seem forcefully wedged into this frail narrative, an unfortunate pitfall that sometimes plagues jukebox musicals. While it certainly doesn’t aspire to the heights of the great American musical — and, to be fair, it doesn't pretend to — its charm lies in the uncomplicated joy it offers, inviting audiences to simply kick back and enjoy.

Despite the scripts's noticeable shortcomings, the Alhambra's execution of *Escape to Margaritaville* is undeniably outstanding. With brilliant lighting design casting a warm, inviting glow reminiscent of a sunset luau throughout the venue and a set that transports you directly to the sandy shores of an island retreat, this production is a feast for the senses. The ingenious lighting, featuring strings of colored lights hanging from the ceiling, wall sconces flickering like tikis, and gobo lights casting tropical plant shadows, sets the stage for an incredibly immersive experience. This, combined with the impeccable set design of colorful and bright LED lights set in ocean breeze-aged wood, brightens the room with an authentic island vibe. From the entrance, the Alhambra transforms into a party island, complete with staff and guests in Hawaiian aloha shirts, further enhancing the festive atmosphere.

*Escape to Margaritaville* is as laid-back as it gets, echoing the ethos of a Jimmy Buffett concert more than a traditional theatre production. This ambiance is accentuated by the clever use of ambient sounds such as ocean waves, tropical birds, and rain throughout the production, though it’s worth noting the vocal and background mix sometimes suffer from muddiness, potentially due to seating proximity to speakers.

Matthew Fecko's portrayal of Tully brings relaxed charisma to the stage, embodying the spirit of a young Jimmy Buffett with admirable ease. Fecko’s strong vocals and fairly competent guitar skills anchor the musical’s laid-back vibe.

Logen Cheatham's portrayal of Rachel breathes life and complexity into a character that, as written, is fairly one-dimensional. Cheatham imbues Rachel with strength, intelligence, and elegance, skillfully elevating the character beyond the worn out trope of the workaholic who's unable to unwind on vacation. Cheatham's dynamic presence on stage not only captivates but serves as a nuanced contrast to the show’s lighter, more whimsical elements.

Tammy and Brick, played by Aarione Magee and Paul Gary, respectively, are the heart of the show. Their adorable chemistry is palpable, creating moments of genuine connection that stand out amid the broader comedy. Magee and Gary’s vocal performances are not only beautiful but imbue their characters with depth and relatability that resonate with the audience.

Victoria Mapayi and Marcus Davis shine as Marley and Jamal, providing comic relief and scene-stealing moments that consistently captivate the audience. Their slightly muddled "island" accents feel genuine, steering clear of cartoonish, over-the-top caricature and enhancing the show’s authentic island atmosphere. Their energy and comedic timing add a vibrant layer to the ensemble, making every scene they’re in a joy to watch.

Surprisingly, two of the show’s most impressive performances come from its smaller roles, J.D. and Chadd, played by Ron Perry and Will Wiley, respectively. Perry’s portrayal of J.D., the quintessential drunkard beach bum, brings a lived-in authenticity that harmonizes perfectly with Buffett’s music. Perry's performance of “Why Don’t We Get Drunk and Screw” was especially hilarious and had the entire audience singing along. Wiley, on the other hand, turns Chadd into a character you love to hate. Each line he delivers is like a jolt, sparking immediate and intense disdain from the audience. His expertise in making Chadd so completely detestable, without veering into caricature, showcases Wiley’s nuanced acting prowess.

The musical offers a whirlwind sampling of Jimmy Buffett’s discography, but a few performances were impressive. Matthew Fecko and Logen Cheatham’s rendition of “Son of a Sailor” shines with genuine warmth, capturing the island spirit, while the trio of Fecko, Paul Gary, and Ron Perry in “He Went to Paris” adds a strong emotional depth, making it a memorable highlight of the show.

Arrione Magee’s vocals in “Cheeseburger in Paradise” are breathtaking, captivating the audience with her powerful performance. Her and the ensemble’s stunning execution of Erick Ariel Sureda’s intense and captivating choreography elevates the piece, showcasing his exceptional talent at transforming a tiny stage into a Broadway-caliber spectacle.

“Volcano” equally captivated audiences with its dynamic blend of humor and tension. Marcus Davis, portraying Jamal, skillfully navigated between being humorously afraid and delivering wonderful vocals. The innovative choreography, utilizing “slow motion,” brilliantly illustrated the vacationers’ chaotic yet humorous escape from the island, adding depth and entertainment to the scene.

*Escape to Margaritaville* at the Alhambra Theatre & Dining cleverly turns a lackluster script into a delightful experience. Despite its narrative shortcomings and a plot that sometimes feels as scattered as beach sand, the production triumphs through spirited performances and an immersive set that whisks audiences away to a tropical haven. This show stands as a testament to the idea that the essence of entertainment often lies more in the execution than the story itself, offering a light-hearted escape that resonates with the relaxed vibes of Jimmy Buffett's music. This production is a reminder that sometimes, all you need is a good laugh, some catchy tunes — and maybe a few margaritas in hand — to make for a great evening out.
