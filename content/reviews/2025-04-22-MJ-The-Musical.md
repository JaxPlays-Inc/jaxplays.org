[[production:2025 MJ The Musical,]] the electrifying Broadway sensation, lands in Jacksonville with a show that not only pays homage to the King of Pop but also delivers a theatrical experience that is as grand as it is intimate. With its opening night at the Jacksonville Center for the Performing Arts, the production sets the stage ablaze with dazzling choreography, stunning visuals and a heartfelt tribute to Michael Jackson’s legacy.<!--more-->

Presented by the [[theatre:FSCJ Artist Series]]’ Broadway in Jacksonville, MJ The Musical transports audiences back in time to the final rehearsals for Michael Jackson’s 1992 [[w:Dangerous World Tour]]. As the crew preps for the spectacle, a journalist from MTV interviews Jackson, prompting a journey through his past — from the Jackson 5 and Motown days to solo superstardom. Through flashbacks and iconic hits, the show explores the pressure, perfectionism and passion behind one of pop music’s most legendary careers.

DeAundre’ Woods shines as MJ, capturing not just the voice and movement of Michael Jackson but the complexity behind the persona. His performance is a respectful, deeply considered rendition that avoids mimicry in favor of emotional truth. With razor-sharp precision and quiet intensity, Woods reveals the artist in constant motion — not just a performer, but a perfectionist navigating pressure, pain and purpose with every breath.

Quentin Blanton Jr. brings wide-eyed energy and vocal brilliance to Little Michael, capturing the spark that launches a global phenomenon. As Michael, Jacobi Kai bridges the space between child star and cultural icon, revealing the toll of fame and the drive to evolve. The moments when MJ shares the stage with Michael and Little Michael — whether in harmony or reflection — are among the most emotionally poignant in the show, offering a powerful glimpse into the internal dialogue of a man shaped by his younger selves. Together, the three portrayals form a layered timeline of MJ’s evolution — from raw talent to refined performer, and finally, to a man reckoning with the legacy he’s building in real time.

Shifting seamlessly between the confident authority of Rob and the strict, battle-worn presence of Joseph Jackson, Devin Bowles gives a standout performance in the dual roles. In a production that showcases physicality, Bowles' subtle and sudden transitions from the confident leader of Rob to the strict, battle-worn Joseph Jackson are genuinely breathtaking. With minimal shifts in posture, tone and expression, he draws a stark emotional line between the two characters. His Joseph isn’t just a disciplinarian — he’s a man hardened by survival and fear, trying to mold his sons into something bulletproof. The result is a performance that carries the weight of history, intention and consequence.

Authority and presence define J. Daughtry’s portrayal of Berry Gordy, grounding scenes with quiet strength and focus. Josh A. Dawson brings charm and cool to Quincy Jones, offering a smooth, steady counterbalance in MJ’s world. And then there’s Anastasia Talley as Katherine Jackson — a performance so rich, so emotionally dialed in, it’s almost wild to see that level of depth in such a small role. Her vocals cut through with clarity and control, carrying both warmth and urgency as she navigates the complexities of being a mother to a budding global superstar.

Individually, these roles are sharply drawn — but together, Joseph Jackson, Katherine Jackson, Berry Gordy and Quincy Jones function almost like a Greek chorus. Woven into MJ’s memories and moments of doubt, they speak with clarity, offer perspective and nudge the narrative forward without ever feeling heavy-handed. It’s an elegant storytelling device, executed with subtlety and impact.

The physicality in *MJ* is next-level — a nonstop display of precision and passion. Derek McLane’s sleek scenic design and Natasha Katz’s bold lighting elevate every movement, but it’s the cast’s execution that makes the show kinetic. Every dance break is a thrill. Every beat feels earned.

Costume design by Tony, Emmy and Oscar winner Paul Tazewell is a visual jolt — bold, meticulous and utterly iconic. Each look lands like a time stamp, instantly transporting the audience to the stages of the past. Sequins catch the light like fireworks, silhouettes shift with every beat and legacy lives in every stitch.

The production design of *MJ* is nothing short of transcendent, thanks to the combined brilliance of scenic designer Derek McLane, projection designer Peter Nigrini and lighting designer Natasha Katz. Together, they craft a world that moves as fluidly as the performers onstage. The use of projection and integrated lighting transforms the set into a whirlwind ride through time and space — from a rehearsal studio in the '90s to the stage of *Showtime at the Apollo* in the '60s, a press conference to the iconic Hollywood sign — all without losing momentum or clarity.

One standout moment uses projection to extend the dance ensemble into the screen, effectively doubling or tripling the perceived size of the stage and number of performers in motion. The illusion is seamless, and the result is visually exhilarating. Every design element works in harmony, not just supporting the story but becoming an essential part of how it's told.

Fans of Michael Jackson’s original recordings may notice that several songs in MJ are performed in slightly lower keys. While Michael, even at his peak, never performed eight full-scale shows a week, Broadway performers do — and they do it week after week. The vocal demands of his music, paired with the show’s relentless choreography, make these adjustments essential for preserving stamina and consistency. Rather than diminishing the material, the result is a performance that feels more grounded and emotionally present — a human-scale tribute to a larger-than-life legacy.

From the first beat to the final bow, *MJ The Musical* is pure kinetic magic. The show doesn’t slow down — and doesn’t need to. Through iconic music, carefully layered flashbacks and dazzling dance sequences, it explores legacy and artistry with nostalgia folded in like a hint of sweetness that brings out the depth in something savory. The show is a celebration, but it’s also a meditation on the cost of fame, the weight of expectation and the relentless pursuit of perfection.

Ultimately, *MJ The Musical* transforms the stage into a pulse-pounding tribute to an icon. Whether you grew up with his music or are discovering it anew, this production is a reminder of Michael Jackson’s enduring influence — and the power of performance done right.
