When Jed Clampett unexpectedly strikes oil on his land in the Ozarks, he and his family — Granny, Elly May, and Jethro — find themselves millionaires and head to Beverly Hills to start a new life. The Clampetts’ simple, rural lifestyle collides hilariously with the world of 1960s high society, creating a series of comedic misadventures as they navigate wealth, snobbish neighbors and cultural clashes.

[[theatre:Artist Connection Theatre]]'s [[production:2024 The Beverly Hillbillies]] offers a nostalgic and humor-filled journey through the adventures of the Clampett family, capturing the essence of the beloved television sitcom with both wit and warmth. From clever characterization, to energetic ensemble work, the production revives the comedic contrasts between the rustic roots of the Clampetts and the upscale absurdity of Beverly Hills’ elite.

The show kicks off on a high note with a live guitarist singing the original theme song from the sitcom — an unexpected delight with skillful picking and vocals that introduce the evening with an engaging sense of down-home authenticity. The initial set reveals a quaint log-cabin-inspired interior, reminiscent of the Clampetts’ cabin in the Missouri wetlands, offering the right balance of simplicity and nostalgia for fans of the original sitcom.

[[person:Shelby Ellis]] shines as Granny, bringing solid comedic timing and a mischievous spark to her lines. [[person:Josh Rutgers]] presents Jed Clampett, the family patriarch, with a grounded sincerity, capturing both his simple wisdom and wide-eyed wonder at the strangeness of his new surroundings. [[person:Camille Blaydes]] brings boundless energy as Elly May embodying the blend of charm and feistiness required for the role, creating plenty of laughs, while also endearing herself to the audience. [[person:Benjamin Moore]]’s Jethro is as loveable as he is dim-witted; he leans fully into the character’s “big lug” persona, embodying Jethro’s sweet simplicity with endearing earnestness.

The high-society figures are also strong in their portrayals: [[person:Lisa Ciardulli]]’s Mrs. Drysdale is a highlight, her snobbish disdain played with just the right level of exaggerated exasperation. [[person:Ja'uan Hay]]’s Mr. Drysdale is charmingly two-faced, his attempts to ingratiate himself with the Clampetts leading to some of the show’s best comic moments. Ciardulli and Hay both lean heavily into almost cartoonish, character voices that add layers to the humor of their performances. [[person:Lacey English]] as Miss Hathaway is another highlight, balancing sophistication with just a hint of the absurd, perfectly conveying her character's uptight yet caring personality, bringing authenticity to her character's quirks. 

[[person:Hayley Sims]] brings a delightful mix of Southern charm and subtle mischief to Emaline Fetty, the daughter of the Fetty family from back home who arrives to visit the Clampetts. [[person:David Voss]]’s portrayal of Colonel Foxhall, complete with a deep Southern accent and a delightfully exaggerated villainous streak, feels like he stepped out of a Saturday morning cartoon, injecting the role with an amusing theatrical flair that is the perfect foil for Jed's simplicity and Mr. Drysdale's duplicity.

The design team captures the nostalgic feel of the '60s sitcom with costumes that bring the Clampetts’ Ozark looks to life while allowing the Beverly Hills residents their own flair for metropolitan style. The audio throughout the performance is crystal clear, allowing each humorous exchange to hit its mark without distraction. And while the performances are generally strong, a tighter pacing overall could amplify the comedic timing — several scenes linger just a moment too long, which diminishes the potential for sharper laughs. A bit of trimming and a quicker cue-to-cue would add more punch to the jokes, keeping the audience engaged and the comedy brisk. Additionally, the set design, while functional, might have benefited from more detailed distinctions between the Clampetts' home and the polished environment of Beverly Hills to visually reinforce the cultural clash at the heart of the story.

Overall, [[production:2024 The Beverly Hillbillies]] succeeds as a lighthearted and engaging adaptation, made memorable by its skilled cast and evident appreciation for the original sitcom's charm. [[theatre:Artist Connection Theatre]] brings to life a beloved American classic, delivering laughs and nostalgia in equal measure.
