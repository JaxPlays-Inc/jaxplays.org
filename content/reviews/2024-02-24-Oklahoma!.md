The Alhambra Theatre & Dining's latest production of _Oklahoma!_ injects refreshing vibrancy into the beloved classic. Under the bright lights of this intimate venue, the cast and crew reinvigorate the timeless tale with a blend of passionate performances, awe-inspiring musical direction and exhilarating choreography that makes the audience want to jump out of their seats.

_Oklahoma!_ is a riveting musical that transports audiences to the heart of America's rugged frontier during the turn of the 20th century. Set against the backdrop of the Oklahoma territory, just before it becomes a state, the musical centers around the blossoming romance between Curly, a charming cowboy, and Laurey, a spirited farm girl, as they find their way to each other amidst rivalries and the complexities of rural life.

Yet, beneath this idyllic surface, the story takes a dark, somber turn with the introduction of Jud Fry. A brooding farmhand with an unsettling obsession for Laurey, Jud's presence weaves a thread of jealousy and menace, adding a poignant depth to the otherwise light-hearted tale. 

Alexander Blanco, stepping into the boots of Curly, sets the stage ablaze from the opening notes. His voice slices through the air, characterized by a pristine clarity and the perfect touch of vibrato. With an undeniable charisma and gravitas, Blanco embodies Curly's blue-eyed optimism, razor-sharp wit and heartfelt love, capturing the quintessential spirit of the character.

Patti Eyler's portrayal of Aunt Eller anchors the production with a sense of warmth and wisdom, setting the tone for a community on the brink of statehood. Eyler brings an unmatched comedic timing that elevates the entire show. She masterfully turns even the simplest of lines into moments of sheer hilarity, making her performance irresistibly delightful.

Isabella Fedele delivers a remarkable portrayal of Laurey, characterized by a voice that is both powerful and beautifully resonant. Her delivery of each note, packed with intensity, captivates the audience, drawing them into the heart of her character's emotional journey. With enunciation that is impeccably sharp and a meticulous attention to detail reminiscent of a young Idina Menzel, Fedele's performance, especially during her poignant monologue, is magnetic. This precision, alongside an emotional range that spans from raw vulnerability to resolute strength, underscores Fedele's exceptional talent, making her performance a standout in the production.

The chemistry between Fedele's Laurey and Blanco's Curly is electric, infusing the production with charm and warmth through their flirtatious interactions. Their playful and lightning-quick transitions from moments of close affection to sharp-witted repulsion exemplify a high caliber of acting, illustrating a nuanced understanding of their characters' complex relationship.

Mel Nash's Will Parker bounds onto the stage, radiating gullible optimism. He skillfully portrays a young man who believes he's worldly, but quickly reveals just how green he truly is. Nash infuses every scene with a boundless energy and infectious joy, lighting up the stage with his presence. His duet with Natalie Drake on "All Er Nuthin" is delightfully endearing, showcasing a charming dynamic between the characters.

Natalie Drake's Ado Annie provides hilarious comedic relief without eclipsing the story's emotional core. Drake perfectly captured Ado Annie’s naivety and earnestness without slipping into caricature. In a cast skilled at delivering Oklahoman accents, Drake's performance shines particularly bright. Her performance is so genuine, it’s as if she's channeling Oklahoma's native daughter, Reba McEntire, right there on stage.

Drake's rendition of "I Cain't Say No" is a showcase of her considerable talent, delivering a performance that is speckled with moments of brilliance, despite a couple of notes straying slightly off-pitch. Far from detracting, these quirks serve to enrich Drake’s portrayal, suggesting a deliberate choice to underscore Ado Annie’s charmingly imperfect nature. This approach aligns with the character's essence, adding authenticity and depth to her portrayal.

Alec Hadden's interpretation of Jud Fry is masterful, weaving together layers of complexity that reveal the character as both formidable and terrifying, yet undeniably human. His nuanced performance finds a delicate balance, generating nerve-wracking tension while simultaneously eliciting empathy. In his solo "Lonely Room," Hadden exposes Jud's profound sadness and isolation, delivering a performance that is both powerful and moving. This skilled portrayal highlights Hadden's ability to navigate the intricacies of a complex sympathetic villain, drawing the audience into the emotional landscape of a character who is as multifaceted as he is misunderstood.

Judd Caldwell delivers a standout performance as the peddler Ali Hakim, navigating the potentially problematic stereotypes with a performance that is as respectful and innovative as it is hilarious. His shifting accent cleverly portrays Hakim as a world-wise con artist rather than a caricature, making him a sympathetic figure amidst the laughter as the con artist finds himself the victim of his own devices.

Erick Ariel Sureda's choreography once again proves to be breathtakingly powerful and emotive, even in its most understated moments, maintaining his streak of excellence across all his productions. Through his choreography, Sureda turns the stage into a vivid narrative landscape, where every movement contributes to the unfolding story. The "Dream Ballet" sequence, enhanced by Johnny Pettegrew's dynamic lighting, elevates the performance into an almost cinematic realm, echoing the grandeur of classic movie musicals.

Cathy Murphy Giddens' musical direction shines brilliantly throughout the production. The ensemble's performance is a testament to her exceptional leadership, showcasing a level of cohesion and harmony that suggests years of collaboration rather than mere weeks of rehearsal. Even in numbers with demanding choreography, the harmonies remain impressively tight, a clear indicator of Giddens' meticulous attention to detail. Key moments, like the massive, spine-tingling crescendo as the ensemble joins in the title song's second chorus, spotlight Giddens' critical influence on the musical's atmosphere. Her mastery in crafting moments like where the "Yeow!" from “When we say, ‘Yeow! A-yip-i-o-ee-ay!’” cracks the air like a bullwhip, showcases her exceptional skill, significantly enriching the show's sonic depth.

The Alhambra Theatre & Dining's _Oklahoma!_ is a breathtaking production that reaffirms the enduring appeal of this musical classic. Under Todd Booth's direction, the show strikes an exquisite balance between realism and musical drama, breathing new life into the cherished tale. His adept handling of the material invites audiences to experience _Oklahoma!_ with a fresh perspective, emphasizing the production's unique blend of talent and creativity. Booth's interpretation enriches this classic musical with a layer of realism often absent in older productions, ensuring its themes and characters resonate deeply with today's audiences.
