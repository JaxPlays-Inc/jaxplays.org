[[theatre:Theatre Jacksonville]]’s *[[production:2024 Mame In Concert]]*, performed at the historic [[venue:Florida Theatre]], offers a concert performance of the beloved 1966 musical, trading elaborate staging for a focus on music and narration. The story centers on the life of Mame Dennis, a free-spirited and glamorous woman who suddenly becomes the guardian of her young nephew, Patrick, following the death of her brother. As Mame navigates the highs and lows of life with her characteristic flair, she introduces Patrick to a world of adventure, love and joy, all while contending with societal expectations and personal challenges. The concert version of Mame distills the essence of the story into its musical and narrative core, capturing the heart of the tale through powerful performances and a breathtaking orchestra.

It’s clear from the murmurs in the audience that some were not aware they were attending a concert rather than a fully staged production. Some express confusion, whispering, “Oh, this is just a concert?” and “It’s just the music?!” However, the concern soon faded away as the 27-piece orchestra, under the direction of conductor, [[person: Joey Chancey]], tunes up. There’s a palpable electricity in the air, a promise of musical brilliance that quickly fills the room. 

[[person:Linda Purl]], known for her televison roles as Pam’s Mom, Helene Beasley on *[[w:The Office (American TV series)|The Office]]* and Ashley Pfister, Fonzie’s fiancee on *[[w:Happy Days]]*, embodies the title character, Mame Dennis, with an exuberant charm that draws the audience in from her very first line. Her portrayal captures Mame's larger-than-life personality, juxtaposing her playful irresponsibility with genuine warmth and affection for her young charge. Purl’s voice is a standout, rich and resonant, with a power that broadcasts Mame’s emotions clearly to the back of the house. Throughout the concert, Purl masterfully adjusts her vocal tone to reflect Mame’s journey through life, allowing her voice to “mature” along with her character — a subtle but effective touch that prevents Mame from becoming a caricature of herself.

As young Patrick Dennis, [[person:Hudson Iracki]] is simply adorable, full of energy and a precociousness that is both endearing and believable. His wide vocal range is impressive for his age, with a warm lower register and crisp high tones that shine through, particularly in his earlier numbers. Though he has a moment of shakiness during the reprise of "My Best Girl" following Mame’s engagement, it only adds to the authenticity of his character, who is navigating the emotional turmoil of such a pivotal moment in his life.

[[person:Sarah Boone]]’s Agnes Gooch is another highlight, an infectious bundle of joy and laughter. Boone captures the sweet awkwardness of Agnes, a character who is at once timid and bursting with hidden potential. Her comedic timing is impeccable, and she manages to keep the character grounded despite the more outlandish moments. Boone’s vocal strength and clarity remain unwavering throughout, even as she delves into the most humorous and physically demanding parts of the role.

Dorothy Bishop’s [[person:Vera Charles]], Mame’s sardonic best friend, provides a perfect foil to Mame’s flamboyance. Bishop’s sharp delivery and commanding stage presence bring out the biting humor and deep loyalty of Vera, creating a dynamic partnership that pulses with history and affection. Meanwhile, [[person:Gary Lee Webber]] as Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside delivers a smooth, Southern charm that’s as intoxicating as a fine bourbon. Webber’s portrayal captures the essence of Beauregard — larger than life, with a hint of roguishness that makes his love for Mame all the more believable.

The ensemble is nothing short of spectacular — a wall of sound that fills the theatre with harmonies that are crystal clear and beautifully blended. Each member contributes to the overall richness of the production, creating an auditory experience that is as satisfying as any fully staged musical.

Special mention must be made of [[person:Lee Hamby]], who steals every scene as the outrageously funny Mother Burnside. Hamby’s performance is larger-than-life, delivering lines with a wit and humor that leave the audience in stitches. His energy is infectious, and he plays off the other actors with a confidence that makes every interaction a delight.

As the older Patrick Dennis, [[person:Daniel Austin]] brings a suave sophistication to the role, effectively showing how Patrick has grown under Mame’s influence. His interactions with Gloria Upson, played by [[person:Abigail Hunger]], are particularly entertaining. Hunger’s Gloria is over-the-top in the best way possible, evoking laughter with her exaggerated voice — a performance reminiscent of Roz from Monsters, Inc., but with a uniquely theatrical flair.

[[person:Ron Shreve]], serving as the affable "onstage" Stage Manager, ties the concert together with a genial presence that guides the audience through the narrative. His clear and engaging narration ensures that even without elaborate staging, the story of Mame remains accessible and engaging.

The emotional climax of the concert, “We Need a Little Christmas,” is a testament to the production’s success. Purl’s transition from desperation to joy fills the song with a deep emotional resonance, capturing the true spirit of the character and the holiday itself.

This concert rendition of *Mame* transforms the Florida Theatre into a space where music reigns supreme, and the narrative unfolds with a raw, emotional potency. Without the distractions of a full set, the production offers something purer, a direct line from the heart of the performers to the soul of the audience. Each character’s journey is underscored by the orchestra’s stirring arrangements, making every song an emotional high point. The simplicity of the staging allows the vibrancy of the characters, the vocal and acting talent of the performers and the richness of the score to shine with unparalleled clarity, making this a unique and unforgettable evening at the theater.
