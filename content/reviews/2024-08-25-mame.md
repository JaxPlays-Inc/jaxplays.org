[[theatre:Theatre Jacksonville]]’s *[[production:Mame In Concert]]*, performed at the historic [[venue:Florida Theatre]], offers a concert performance of the beloved 1966 musical, trading elaborate staging for a focus on music and narration. The story centers on the life of Mame Dennis, a free-spirited and glamorous woman who suddenly becomes the guardian of her young nephew, Patrick, following the death of her brother. As Mame navigates the highs and lows of life with her characteristic flair, she introduces Patrick to a world of adventure, love, and joy, all while contending with societal expectations and personal challenges. The concert version of Mame distills the essence of the story into its musical and narrative core, capturing the heart of the tale through powerful performances and a breathtaking orchestra.

The audience buzzes with anticipation as the 27-piece orchestra, under the direction of a seasoned conductor, tunes up. There’s a palpable electricity in the air, a promise of musical brilliance that quickly fills the room. However, it’s clear from the murmurs in the audience that not everyone is aware they’ve signed up for a concert rather than a fully staged production. Some express confusion, whispering, “Oh, this is just a concert?” and “It’s just the music?!” Yet, as soon as the first notes are played, any doubts begin to melt away.

[[person:Linda Purl]] embodies the title character, Mame Dennis, with an exuberant charm that draws the audience in from her very first line. Her portrayal captures Mame's larger-than-life personality, juxtaposing her playful irresponsibility with genuine warmth and affection for her young charge. Purl’s voice is a standout, rich and resonant, with a power that broadcasts Mame’s emotions clearly to the back of the house. Throughout the concert, Purl masterfully adjusts her vocal tone to reflect Mame’s journey through life, allowing her voice to “mature” along with her character—a subtle but effective touch that prevents Mame from becoming a caricature of herself.

As young Patrick Dennis, Hudson Iracki is simply adorable, full of energy and a precociousness that is both endearing and believable. His wide vocal range is impressive, with a warm lower register and crisp high tones that shine through, particularly in his earlier numbers. Though he has a moment of shakiness during the reprise of "My Best Girl" following Mame’s engagement, it only adds to the authenticity of his character, who is navigating the emotional turmoil of such a pivotal moment in his life.

Sarah Boone’s Agnes Gooch is another highlight, an infectious bundle of joy and laughter. Boone captures the sweet awkwardness of Agnes, a character who is at once timid and bursting with hidden potential. Her comedic timing is impeccable, and she manages to keep the character grounded despite the more outlandish moments. Boone’s vocal strength and clarity remain unwavering throughout, even as she delves into the most humorous and physically demanding parts of the role.

Dorothy Bishop’s Vera Charles, Mame’s sardonic best friend, provides a perfect foil to Mame’s flamboyance. Bishop’s sharp delivery and commanding stage presence bring out the biting humor and deep loyalty of Vera, creating a dynamic partnership that pulses with history and affection. Meanwhile, Gary Lee Webber as Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside delivers a smooth, Southern charm that’s as intoxicating as a fine bourbon. Webber’s portrayal captures the essence of Beauregard—larger than life, with a hint of roguishness that makes his love for Mame all the more believable.

The ensemble is nothing short of spectacular—a wall of sound that fills the theatre with harmonies that are crystal clear and beautifully blended. Each member contributes to the overall richness of the production, creating an auditory experience that is as satisfying as any fully staged musical.

Special mention must be made of Lee Hamby, who steals every scene as the outrageously funny Mother Burnside. Hamby’s performance is larger-than-life, delivering lines with a wit and humor that leave the audience in stitches. His energy is infectious, and he plays off the other actors with a confidence that makes every interaction a delight.

As the older Patrick Dennis, Daniel Austin brings a suave sophistication to the role, effectively showing how Patrick has grown under Mame’s influence. His interactions with Gloria Upson, played by Abigail Hunger, are particularly entertaining. Hunger’s Gloria is over-the-top in the best way possible, evoking laughter with every exaggerated line and gesture—a performance reminiscent of Roz from Monsters, Inc., but with a uniquely theatrical flair.

Ron Shreve, serving as the affable Stage Manager and Narrator, ties the concert together with a genial presence that guides the audience through the narrative. His clear and engaging narration ensures that even without elaborate staging, the story of Mame remains accessible and engaging.

The emotional climax of the concert, “We Need a Little Christmas,” is a testament to the production’s success. Purl’s transition from desperation to joy fills the song with a deep emotional resonance, capturing the true spirit of the character and the holiday itself. The audience, now fully immersed in the experience, responds with rapturous applause.

Mame In Concert may not have the bells and whistles of a fully staged production, but what it lacks in visual spectacle, it more than makes up for in musical excellence and heartfelt performances. Theatre Jacksonville’s decision to present Mame in this format highlights the strength of the material and the talents of its cast and orchestra, making it a memorable experience for all who attended.
