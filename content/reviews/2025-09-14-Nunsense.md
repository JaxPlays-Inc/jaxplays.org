The [[theatre:Limelight Theatre]] production of [[production:2025 Nunsense]] is a joyful, laugh-filled romp that celebrates the playful side of musical theater. From start to finish, it brims with energy, wit and charm, offering an evening of comfort and comedy in equal measure.

The story itself is delightfully offbeat: a group of nuns putting on a variety show to raise money after a few missteps. What makes it so endearing is the way the music and humor flow — some songs are presented as rehearsed numbers for the sisters’ fundraiser, while others burst forth as spontaneous expressions of character and circumstance. This balance adds to the show’s quirky appeal and keeps the evening unpredictable.

One of the most delightful aspects of this production is the complete absence of a fourth wall. The sisters are fully aware of the audience and play to them constantly, with jokes, asides and moments of banter. At times, they even involve audience members directly, folding the crowd into the action as though everyone is part of their fundraiser. This creates a uniquely engaging atmosphere — part performance, part community gathering — that keeps the laughter rolling.

The cast shines across the board, with several standout performances. [[person:Facia Lee]] brings magnetic energy to Sister Robert Ann, stealing every scene with the same exuberance her character craves. [[person:Kaylee Byers]] is a delight as the sweet and silly Sister Mary Amnesia, striking the perfect balance of innocence and humor that instantly wins the audience over. [[person:Charity Walton]]’s Sister Mary Leo is full of grace and charm, grounding the show with warmth.  

[[person:Joann Nance]] as Reverend Mother and [[person:Grace Lewis]] as Sister Mary Hubert bring authority and wit, guiding their wayward sisters with a mix of firmness and exasperated affection. Together, they round out the ensemble beautifully, making the group feel like a true family.  

[[person:Keith Teepen]]’s touch as music director is evident throughout. The harmonies are crisp, the projection strong, and the live interplay between the cast and Teepen himself adds unexpected layers of comedy. His dry, understated responses to the nuns’ antics draw some of the night’s best laughs. The live band — a modest trio of keyboard, drums and flute — reinforces the feeling that we’re watching a haphazardly produced fundraiser concert, while also adding richness and depth to the soundscape.  

Directors [[person:Daniel Starling]] and [[person:Heather Starling]] keep the show moving at a brisk, lively pace, ensuring that every moment brims with personality and fun.  

[[production:2025 Nunsense]] is exactly what its title promises: a celebration of silliness that delights in not taking itself too seriously. At [[theatre:Limelight Theatre]], it’s performed with such spirit and affection that audiences can’t help but laugh along.
