Stepping into the Edgar Allan Poe Speakeasy is like entering a different realm – one where misty fog and beautiful lighting set the stage for an evening of Poe's timeless tales. The ambiance, fun yet eerie, is complemented by a delightful play on Poe puns, making for an environment that's as poetic as it is spirited. The Edgar Allan Poe Speakeasy weaves a tapestry of shadow and spirit, turning a night out into a gothic reverie.

Bryan Allred, our master of ceremonies, leads the charge with infectious energy and a corny charm that serves as a playful welcome respite from the evening's darker undertones. He introduces the first drink, the "Pale Blue Eye," a light, fruit-infused concoction with a surprisingly complex palate, setting the tone for an evening of sophisticated indulgence.

Kirsten Lindemulder's rendition of “The Tell-Tale Heart” transcends a mere recitation, elevating it to an immersive one-woman show. Her portrayal weaves a tale so vivid, it feels as if she's personally lived through the harrowing story, masterfully blending macabre and realism. Her command of the dynamic range throughout the performance is — quite literally — breathtaking, adding depth and emotion to Poe's haunting narrative.

The second drink, "The Cats Meow," a sweet, strong blend of bourbon, apple brandy, and vanilla milk, is a nod to Poe's own favorite drink the Brandy Milk Punch. 

In "The Black Cat," Davien Harlis blurred the line between the stage and the spectral, making Poe's words leap into our reality. The lighting, often casting deep, menacing shadows on Harlis's face or completely covering him in a cloak of darkness, added an extra layer of intrigue to the performance.

The evening's third drink, "The Nevermore," was the only miss for me.  It was an ambitious blend of peach and orange blossom infused vodka, fresh lime juice, simple syrup, and a garnish of dehydrated lime. While the ingredients promised a tantalizing fusion, the combination of peach and citrus somehow didn't harmonize as expected, leaving a less than desirable impression on the palate.

However, this minor setback was quickly forgotten when Kirsten Lindemulder returned with “The Raven.” Her performance was both beautiful and agonizing, capturing the deep melancholy of Poe's work. She brought the poem's haunting atmosphere to life, making each emotion palpably felt. Her portrayal, resonating with grief and madness, was a standout moment of the evening, leaving a lasting impression on the audience. Lindemulder's rendition of "The Raven" was a haunting ballet of emotion, each word a step deeper into the abyss of Poe’s mind.

The final beverage of the evening, “Cocktail of Red Death,” was a refreshing and artfully crafted mix of rosemary-infused watermelon juice with a robust 100-proof vodka and citrus vodka, balanced out by the tartness of fresh lime juice.

Davien Harlis returned to the stage captivating the audience with a haunting rendition of “The Masque of the Red Death.” His portrayal of the demonic plague was both terrorizing and mesmerizing, immersing the audience into Poe's macabre world. The performance was heightened by skillful technical effects, which added a jolting and chilling dimension to the tale. Harlis's deep immersion in the character and the story’s dark theme left the audience spellbound, making it a memorable finale to the evening's performances.

The Edgar Allan Poe Speakeasy isn’t just entertainment; it’s an elegy to the gothic, a night where every detail sings a hymn to the master of macabre. It's a fully immersive, carefully curated experience. Every detail, from the themed drinks to the staff in 19th-century gothic attire and accents, contributed to an unforgettable atmosphere. The cast and crew were not only talented but also incredibly friendly and helpful, staying in character to enhance the authenticity of the night. They were well-prepared with a variety of alternative options, including non-alcoholic versions of each themed cocktail and allergy-friendly choices, ensuring an inclusive experience for all attendees. This attention to detail made the evening uniquely captivating, truly celebrating Poe's timeless work and the creative spirit of those who brought it to life.

The Edgar Allan Poe Speakeasy tour, having swiftly sold out in Jacksonville even before its opening night at the Riverside House from January 4th to 6th, offers a beacon of hope for those yet to experience its magic. The tour eagerly continues, bringing its captivating mix of performance and mixology to Gainesville and Ocala later this month. Given the high demand witnessed in Jacksonville, it's advisable for enthusiasts in these cities, or those willing to travel, to act swiftly. Chances are high that tickets will sell out quickly, just as they did in Jacksonville. This is more than just a show; it's a theatrical and sensory journey not to be missed, so keep a vigilant eye out for ticket availability.
