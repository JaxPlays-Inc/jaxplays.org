*[Boeing Boeing](/productions/2024-boeing-boeing/)* at the Alhambra Theatre & Dining, is a high-flying farce that catapults audiences into the comedic chaos of Bernard, a smooth-talking and insanely chauvinistic bachelor juggling three fiancées --- all flight attendants on different airlines. The unexpected arrival of his school friend, Robert, coincides with the airlines introducing newer, faster jets, disrupting the stewardesses' flight plans and unraveling Bernard's meticulously scheduled life in a delightful turbulence of confusion and comedy.<!--more-->

The play opens in a sprawling Paris apartment outfitted with four bedrooms, two futons and a tie-dye bean bag, bringing a modern yet retro flair that serves as the perfect backdrop for the cleverly coordinated chaos that unfolds.

Todd Booth's direction of *Boeing Boeing* is phenomenal, infusing the production with dynamic energy that mirrors the constant activity of a bustling airport. His complex blocking orchestrates the actors like a symphony of planes smoothly navigating the runways, adding layers of hilarity and fully utilizing the entire stage. This choreography of movement enhances the abundance of physical comedy, while Booth's keen eye transforms even the most ordinary dialogue into laugh-out-loud moments. His encouragement for the actors to fully commit to their roles is evident, giving the show a sparkle and lightness, making it irresistibly engaging from start to finish.

The costuming, masterfully crafted by Taylor Barnett, resonates with authenticity and originality. Particularly notable is Gabriella's casual outfit, a testament to the era's complex fashion sensibilities. It epitomizes '60s elegance and chic, yet subtly hints at the discomfort such stylish attire often required. The stewardesses' uniforms strike a balance between being crisply professional and comfortably lived-in. Each outfit feels authentic to the period, embodying the era's aesthetic without resorting to replication, and suggesting they could be worn by real flight attendants of the time, blending historical accuracy with creative design.

Thad Walker's Bernard begins as the epitome of cool sophistication, masterfully handling the absurd complexities of his love life with a sultry and charming transatlantic finesse. Yet, as his carefully crafted web of deceptions starts to unravel, he devolves into a pure manifestation of panic. Walker's portrayal is delightful to watch as Bernard frantically juggles the crumbling pieces and spirals out of control, suffering from the fate of his own actions.

Lisa Valdini Booth's Berthe, the steadfast maid in charge of Bernard's flat, brilliantly counters with a gruff, no-nonsense demeanor that provides grounding --- and plenty of laughs --- as she meticulously manages his chaotic lifestyle with increasing desperation and exhaustion. Booth executes a perfect three-point landing every time with her deadpan responses, showcasing her mastery of comedic timing.

Natalie Drake's portrayal of Gloria is a comedic triumph, blending over-the-top antics with boundless energy. As a brilliant feminist foil, her sharp wit and impeccable timing not only challenge Bernard's misogyny but also cleverly expose the inconsistencies in gender dynamics. 

Allyson Rosenblum's Gabriella, on the other hand, flows through her scenes with grace and poise, painting a picture of elegance that beautifully contrasts with the play's overarching zaniness. Her performance deftly oscillates between her passionate exterior and her deep desire for a settled, home-centered life.

Rodney Holmes adeptly portrays Robert, Bernard's charmingly anxious school buddy from Wisconsin. While he channels the spirit of icons like Don Knotts and Jerry Lewis, Holmes ensures that his portrayal steers clear of mere imitation. Holmes infuses Robert with a fresh, distinctive character that feels both entirely original and oddly familiar. Holmes's physical comedy is a masterwork, providing a series of brilliantly timed and executed moments that keep the audience in stitches.

Jessie Clontz as Gretchen bursts onto the stage with an electrifying energy that completely captivates the audience. Her mastery of physical comedy is remarkable, enveloping the theater in waves of vibrant, infectious laughter. Every scene with Clontz is a display of pure comedic talent, with her relentless commitment to her character making each scene she appears in a standout moment of the show. 

From takeoff to landing, *Boeing Boeing* is a first-class experience, packed with enough laughter to rival the engine roar of a jet. As an audience member, you feel as if you've taken a direct flight onto the set of a classic '60s TV show, immersing you in every laugh and comedic turn as if you were part of a live studio audience from a bygone era. Expect an enjoyable ride filled with sharp turns of wit and high-flying hilarity, ensuring everyone disembarks with a smile. Be sure to book your seat before the final boarding call!
