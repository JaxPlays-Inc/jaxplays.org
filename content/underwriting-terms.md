-   Renewal is not automatic. Underwriters will be notified of expiration and may renew upon availability.

### 5. **Content Responsibility**

Underwriters are responsible for the accuracy of all submitted materials. JaxPlays is not liable for errors in submitted content or for results derived from placement.

### 6. **Non-Endorsement Clause**

Placement of underwriting content does not constitute an endorsement by JaxPlays. All content is clearly labeled as underwriting to distinguish it from editorial material.

### 9. **Changes and Updates**

JaxPlays reserves the right to update these Terms at any time. Underwriters will be notified of material changes and have the right to cancel future placements if they disagree with the revised terms.
