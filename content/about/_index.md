## Who is JaxPlays?

In November 2019, [Ray Hollister](https://rayhollister.com) faced a problem many theatre enthusiasts in Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia know all too well: the absence of a one-stop source for all things live theatre. 

Struggling to keep tabs on upcoming shows required endless clicks through various websites and social media feeds. On top of that, tracing an actor or crew member's career involved a dusty dive into mountains of playbills. Recognizing these as common challenges, he conceived JaxPlays—a streamlined hub aimed at alleviating both issues.

The journey wasn't straightforward. Though the project went on hiatus due to the global upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it was far from forgotten. Resuming in 2022, the platform underwent multiple evolutions, switching gears from MediaWiki to Wordpress, from Wordpress to Jekyll, and finally settling on Hugo as the technological backbone.

Realizing that the vision for JaxPlays should be a community endeavor with longevity that surpassed his own involvement, Ray brought together a circle of like-minded theatre aficionados. 

In September 2023, the project matured from a passion project into a [tax-exempt 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization](https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/dl/FinalLetter_93-3315574_JAXPLAYSINC_09082023_00.pdf), complete with a committed board of directors:

- President & Executive Director: Ray Hollister
- Vice President: Jo El Snyder
- Treasurer: Robert Snyder
- Secretary: Amber Hollister

We welcome your contributions and expertise as we aim to make JaxPlays the definitive resource for live theatre in Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia.
