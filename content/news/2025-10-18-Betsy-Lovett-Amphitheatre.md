Oct. 17, 2025 | Jacksonville, Fla. — Douglas Anderson School of the Arts has opened the Betsy Lovett Amphitheatre, a 5,000-square-foot outdoor venue at the center of its Southbank campus. The space will serve all 10 arts programs for performances, rehearsals and events, with seating for up to 300, a covered roof, lights and rigging for additional stage lighting and speakers.<!--more-->

Work began in 2012 when the amphitheatre’s foundation was poured during a campus project. Former principal Jackie Cornelius partnered with architect Tom Rensing, patron Betsy Lovett and the [Developing Artists Foundation](https://www.developingartistsfoundation.org/) to raise funds. The timeline stretched because construction costs climbed, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted planning and labor, and the project depended on private donations rather than district funding. The foundation kept the project alive through each setback until full funding and construction were secured.

Principal Timothy Feagins said the new stage expands how students learn. “Performing in the open air presents unique challenges and learning opportunities that are completely different from a traditional theater,” he said. “I’m elated to see how this space inspires and enriches our students’ creativity. A special thanks goes to the DA Foundation for making this a reality.”

The $1.18 million project was paid for entirely by community contributions to the Developing Artists Foundation, with major support from the late Betsy Lovett, Preston Haskell and Ann Hicks. Scherer Construction led the build. Haskell provided engineering support. Landscaping came from Greenscape of Jacksonville, Mulch Masters, volunteers from the senior class of 2026 and Aspire Church.

Rensing, owner of KBJ Architects, designed the structure to match his other DA projects, including the rotunda, atrium, jazz building and vocal performance building. The roof’s sweeping lines wrap the stage to create a distinctive outdoor classroom and performance space.

“Across cultures throughout history, amphitheatres have brought communities together,” said Erin Vance Skinner, president of the DA Foundation. “Adding this incredible venue to DA’s campus has been a long-term dream for the Developing Artists Foundation. We’re grateful to the donors and partners who brought it to life.”
