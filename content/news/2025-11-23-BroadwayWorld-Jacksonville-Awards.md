description: "Jacksonville BroadwayWorld Awards voting now open for 2025 Regional Awards. Cast ballots through Dec 31 for local theatre productions, artists and companies."
---
The BroadwayWorld Jacksonville Awards are back, celebrating the productions and people who kept local stages busy over the past year. As part of BroadwayWorld’s annual Regional Awards, the Jacksonville edition looks only at work from our corner of Florida, covering productions from as far west as Gainesville and as far south as Palm Coast.

Jacksonville area artists, productions and companies are competing with fellow locals, not theatres from across the state or country. The ballot becomes a snapshot of the past year on First Coast stages, filtered through the audiences who filled the seats and sent in their favorites.

The 2025 Regional Awards honor productions and performances that had their first show between October 1, 2024 and September 30, 2025. BroadwayWorld’s local editors set the categories, then readers submitted their favorite performers, designers and shows.

Voting runs through December 31, 2025. You can vote once per category per email address. Winners will be announced in January after the polls close.

If you want to see how Jacksonville’s stages stack up and help decide which artists take home the honors, you can cast your ballot here:
