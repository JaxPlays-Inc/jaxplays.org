The [[theatre:Alhambra Theatre & Dining]] has been voted the [No. 1 dinner theater in the United States](https://10best.usatoday.com/awards/best-dinner-theater/) by readers of *USA TODAY*, topping the publication’s annual 10Best Readers’ Choice Awards.<!--more-->

The national recognition marks a major milestone for the Jacksonville institution, which first opened its doors in 1967. Known for its unique blend of Broadway-style productions and three-course meals served in an intimate setting, the Alhambra holds the distinction of being the longest continuously operating professional dinner theater in the country.

“We are honored and humbled to receive this incredible recognition,” said Craig Smith, the Alhambra’s managing partner. “It’s a testament to our dedicated staff and talented performers, and most importantly, the loyal Season Partners and guests who continue to support the Alhambra year after year. This award belongs to them as much as it does to us.”

Over the decades, the Alhambra has staged everything from beloved musicals and comedies to classic dramas and holiday shows. The venue has also welcomed well-known performers, including soap opera stars, television icons and Broadway veterans. Despite changes in ownership and evolving tastes, the Alhambra has remained a fixture of the Northeast Florida arts scene for nearly 60 years.

USA TODAY’s 10Best Readers’ Choice Awards are an annual celebration of excellence across travel, food, entertainment and lifestyle categories. Each award begins with a panel of experts who select 20 nominees in a given category. Readers then vote to determine the top 10. In the Dinner Theater category, the Alhambra rose to the top of a highly competitive list that included venues across the country.

Recent Alhambra productions have included [[production:2025 West Side Story]] and [[production:2024 Oklahoma!]]. Upcoming productions include [[production:2025 My Fair Lady]], opening May 15, and [[production:2025 Come From Away]], opening Aug. 28.

“This isn’t just a win for the Alhambra,” Smith added. “It’s a win for Jacksonville and the entire Northeast Florida arts community.”
