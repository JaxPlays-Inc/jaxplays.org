Two of Jacksonville’s leading arts organizations — [[theatre:Theatre Jacksonville]] and the [[venue:Florida Theatre]] — are teaming up to bring a concert-style staging of the classic Broadway musical [[production:2025 A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]] to the Florida Theatre this summer. The production will run for two performances only: Saturday, Aug. 23 at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday, Aug. 24 at 2 p.m.<!--more-->

The musical will feature Tony Award winner [[person:Cady Huffman]] in the lead role of Pseudolus. Huffman won a Tony, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Award for her performance in *The Producers* and has appeared in Broadway productions of *Chicago*, *La Cage Aux Folles*, *Steel Pier* and more. She is also known for her television work, including recurring roles on *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, *Blue Bloods* and *The Good Wife* and a long-running stint as a judge on *Iron Chef America*.

Written by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, *A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum* is a fast-paced, farcical comedy inspired by the plays of ancient Roman writer Plautus. Known for its opening number “Comedy Tonight,” the show follows a cunning slave who tries to gain her freedom by helping her master win the love of a neighboring girl. The musical won six Tony Awards, including Best Musical, for its original 1962 Broadway run.

Jean Tait returns to direct the production after helming last year’s [[production:2024 Mame in Concert]] at the same venue. Broadway conductor [[person:Joey Chancey]], a Jacksonville native, will lead the 26-piece symphony and 30-member chorus. Chancey’s credits include *An American in Paris*, *Beautiful: The Carole King Musical* and national tours of *La Cage Aux Folles* and *A Chorus Line*.

Unlike a traditional stage musical, the “in concert” format places the focus on the music and dialogue rather than sets or costumes. The cast performs in formal concert attire, with the orchestra and chorus seated onstage behind them. The format evokes the atmosphere of an old-style radio play and provides local talent with the rare opportunity to perform with a full orchestra on one of the city’s most storied stages.

“It is an opportunity for the Florida Theatre to expand its impact and be more involved with the local acting community,” said Florida Theatre President Numa Saisselin. “It is also an opportunity for some of Jacksonville’s most talented exports, like Joey Chancey, to come home and ply his craft for the hometown audience.”

Sarah Boone, executive director of Theatre Jacksonville and cast member in the role of Domina, echoed that sentiment. “After last year’s success with *Mame*, we’re excited to bring *A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum* to the Florida Theatre stage. Once again, we're providing an exceptional opportunity for our local actors, musicians and technicians to create art in this historic space.”

The cast also includes Andy Moritz (Senex), Brennan Moritz (Hero), [[person:Morgan Perry]] (Philia), [[person:Neal Thorburn]] (Hysterium), [[person:Michael Porter]] (Erronius), [[person:Alec Hadden]] (Miles Gloriosus), Josh Waller (Lycus) and several others in featured and ensemble roles.
