In a recent conversation with Anne Schindler on [First Coast Connect](https://news.wjct.org/show/first-coast-connect/2024-12-19/on-fridays-show-first-coast-week-in-review), [JaxPlays](/) Executive Director and theatre critic Ray Hollister offered an inside look at what’s lighting up local stages this holiday season and what’s on the horizon in the New Year.

For December, Hollister spotlighted several festive productions now running, including [[production:2024 A Christmas Story The Musical]] at the Alhambra Theatre & Dining. Adapted by the same creative team behind [[production:2024 Dear Evan Hansen]], it brings a fresh energy to the beloved holiday classic. Meanwhile, the Spotlight Event Center’s take on [[production:2024 A Year Without a Santa Claus]] and Apex Theatre Studio’s [[production:2024 It’s A Wonderful Life: Live Radio Play]] deliver fun and nostalgia for families looking to soak up seasonal spirit. And for those craving a break from all things yuletide, [[production:2024 Summer: The Donna Summer Musical]] at Players by the Sea infuses the stage with disco energy.

All theatres will go dark after Christmas until January 7, but musical theatre nerds can still get their fix at the cinema with a sing-along version of *[Wicked](https://wickedmovie.com)* at local movie theaters over the holiday lull.

Looking ahead to 2024, Hollister highlighted [[production:2025 The Women of Lockerbie]] at Theatre Jacksonville, a poignant drama centered around healing and grief in the aftermath of the tragedy of the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing. Lighter fare comes with big-name musicals like [[production:2025 Mamma Mia!]] from the FSCJ Artist Series and lively comedies like [[production:2025 Southern Fried Funeral]] at the Alhambra Theatre & Dining.

For those who adore literary classics, the coming months bring dueling versions of Roald Dahl’s chocolatey worlds with [[production:2025 Roald Dahls Willy Wonka|Willy Wonka]] at Artist Connection Theatre and [[production:2025 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]] at the Alhambra. Fans of stage thrills can anticipate [[production:2025 Misery]] at ABET, while families can look forward to [[production:2025 The Jungle Book]] and [[production:2025 Peter Pan]] for kid-friendly fun.

Shindler reminded listeners that [jaxplays.org](/) is a comprehensive resource for [show listings](/calendar), interviews, [theatre reviews](/reviews) and deeper insights into local productions. With so much variety — holiday romps, dramatic tearjerkers, beloved musicals and kid-friendly adventures — there’s something for everyone to enjoy on Jacksonville’s stages now and well into the New Year.
