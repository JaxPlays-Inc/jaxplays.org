High school students across Northeast Florida will have free access to professional theatre in 2025, thanks to a new initiative by [[theatre:Lumen Repertory Theatre]]. As part of its mission to engage the next generation of artists and audiences, the company is offering complimentary admission to its *Subversive Season* productions.

Students can reserve free tickets by using the code **NEXTGEN** at checkout on Lumen Rep’s website. A valid student ID must be presented at the performance, but there is no limit to how many times a student can use the offer throughout the season.

“We believe there’s no better place than the theatre for young people to question the world around them, challenge expectations and discover their own voices,” said Brian Niece, Lumen Rep’s artistic director. “By removing financial barriers, we’re inviting them to explore new perspectives, spark conversations and ultimately shape the future of our cultural dialogue.”

Lumen Repertory Theatre's *Subversive Season* features three productions aimed at sparking conversation and challenging perspectives:

- [[production:2025 Agnes of God]] – A psychological drama exploring faith, trauma and truth.
- [[production:2025 American Buffalo]] – David Mamet’s sharp critique of loyalty and ambition in American capitalism.
- [[production:2025 Harlan and Bronna Jump Out the Window]] – A new work by [[w:Michael Jacobs (producer)|Michael Jacobs]] examining the limits of love and despair.

Lumen Rep encourages parents, educators and students to take advantage of the program, making theatre an integral part of arts education.
