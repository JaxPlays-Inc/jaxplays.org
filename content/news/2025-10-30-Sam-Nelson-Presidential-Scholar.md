Samuel Issac Nelson III has been named a 2025 U.S. Presidential Scholar, one of the nation’s highest honors for high school seniors.

Nelson, a member of Douglas Anderson School of the Arts' class of 2025, is one of only 161 students recognized nationwide and among just 20 honored for achievement in the arts. He is one of three recipients from Florida and the only one from Jacksonville.<!--more-->

The U.S. Presidential Scholars Program, established in 1964 by the U.S. Department of Education, recognizes students for academic, artistic, and technical excellence, as well as leadership and community service. Since 1979, the program has included categories for the visual, literary, and performing arts. Scholars receive a medallion during a national ceremony in Washington, D.C.

A graduate of DA’s musical theatre department, Nelson stood out as both a performer and student leader. He served as vice president of the Class of 2025 and was active in Fellowship of Christian Artists, Black Arts, and the International Thespian Society.

His achievements include being named a 2025 YoungArts Winner with Distinction in Musical Theatre, earning NAACP ACT-SO regional gold medals in Original Essay and Classical Voice, and winning 10 Critic’s Choice awards at the District Thespian Competition.

On stage, Nelson appeared in productions such as Hadestown (Hermes), Once on This Island (Agwe), The Crucible (Reverend Hale), Chicago (Ensemble), and Next to Normal (Dan). His performance in Next to Normal earned him Outstanding Lead Performer honors at the 11th Annual Applause Awards at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts in Orlando.

Nelson credits the Developing Artists Foundation for providing opportunities that expanded his artistic training and exposure through guest artist workshops, production support, and travel experiences.

“Sam’s success is a shining example of why it is so important to invest in the artistic journeys of young people,” said Erin Vance Skinner, board chair of the Developing Artists Foundation. “His national recognition reinforces the quality of a DA education, which prepares students for success at the nation’s top conservatories, art institutes, and universities.”

Principal Timothy Feagins said Nelson’s achievement underscores DA’s national reputation. “We are committed to nurturing the next generation of creative leaders by providing exceptional arts education and opportunities that reflect the highest standards in the nation,” he said.
