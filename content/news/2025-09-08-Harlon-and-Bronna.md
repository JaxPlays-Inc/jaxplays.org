A new play from one of television’s most recognizable creative voices is making its world premiere in Jacksonville this month. Michael Jacobs, the Emmy-nominated creator behind hit sitcoms *Boy Meets World* and *My Two Dads*, is bringing his latest work, [[production:2025 Harlan and Bronna Jump Out the Window]], to the stage with [[theatre:Lumen Repertory Theatre]].

“In the end it’s a metaphor for what we’re currently going through with our world situation,” Jacobs said on *First Coast Connect on WJCT News 89.9*. “But that’s not entertaining. What’s entertaining is a couple who live on the 34th floor in Manhattan who look down upon all of the people on the street and are informed that they’re down to their last million dollars.”

The play follows a wealthy couple facing a choice between scaling back their lives or spending everything in a final act of defiance. “She says, 'Or we could spend it all and jump out the window,'” Jacobs explained. “And the play is about their adventure in getting rid of all of their resources, much as the world is doing now, and deciding in the end, is humanity down there on the street worth knowing? And that’s the joy of the play, their trajectory.”

Though its themes touch on privilege and collapse, Jacobs emphasized its humor. “Yes. It’s very funny.” he said. Citing Mel Brooks, he added, “Tragedy is when I have a hangnail. Comedy is when you fall into an open manhole and die. Right? So I think that an audience getting to watch the travail of people that they would kind of like to be in trouble will entertain them.”entr

Jacobs is best known for his decades in Hollywood, where his credits also include *Charles in Charge* and the Oscar-nominated film *Quiz Show*. But the decision to debut in Jacksonville came from an unexpected reconnection. Jacobs recalled that Rob, a former high school classmate who once carried a spear in Jacobs’ senior-year production of *Richard III*, reached out years later. “Rob says, 'Would you consider working with us? I’m the president of a board of an Equity company in Jacksonville.' So immediately you take that seriously,” Jacobs said. “It happens that I’ve had an idea for years, and it might be time to write this play.” Actors’ Equity Association is the national labor union representing actors and stage managers in live theater.

For Brian Niece, artistic director of Lumen Repertory Theatre, the partnership marks a milestone for the young company. “I mean it’s huge. We’re only in our third season. And we said as Northeast Florida’s only fully professional nonprofit theater company that we were going to do big things and take big swings,” Niece said on *First Coast Connect*. “We do that in investing in Equity actors and in designers. We do that in debuting new work… And I do think I agree with Michael, the audience is going to be immensely entertained.”

Niece added that the production uses theatrical tools in unexpected ways. “That happens in this play quite often that different characters and different people you may not expect even technicians and others would recognize the audience’s presence,” he said. “So, we are embracing the idea that we are putting on a play for you and you’re in on the joke.”

Jacobs, who is directing the production himself, said he was drawn to Lumen’s commitment to craft. “His success here with Lumen is really attractive and I’m hoping I can contribute with this play,” he said of Niece. “All my life I’ve tried to honor the audience… the audience is representative of the humanity that Harlan and Bronna have never really met.”

[[production:2025 Harlan and Bronna Jump Out the Window]] runs September 19 through October 4 at [[venue:Betsy Lovett Hall|Good Shepherd Episcopal Church’s Lovett Hall]]. “There we have an opening night gala where, for a little bit extra, you get to show up early, complimentary drinks, food, etc. get to mingle with Michael and some other New York representatives, our cast, creatives, some other luminaries in the city,” Niece said. 

High school and college students can attend free with the code "NEXTGEN". “We want to tear down all of the barriers that prevent the next generation from experiencing and falling in love with professional theater,” Niece said.
