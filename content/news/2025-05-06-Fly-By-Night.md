A blackout rolls across New York City. Somewhere in the dark, a deli worker dreams of something more, a waitress reads the stars and a young actress rehearses her next big break. Their lives are unremarkable — until they collide.<!--more-->

[[theatre:Limelight Theatre]] brings this quietly ambitious musical to the stage May 9 through May 25 in St. Augustine. Set against a city paused by circumstance, [[production:2025 Fly By Night]] unfolds like a memory — intimate, lyrical and full of strange timing. It’s a story about people reaching for meaning in moments both big and barely noticeable, and the unseen threads that bind them.

The story follows Harold, a melancholy sandwich maker, whose life intertwines with two sisters: Daphne, an aspiring actress, and Miriam, a stargazing waitress. As their paths cross in unexpected ways, a mysterious prophecy looms, challenging their notions of destiny and connection.

With a score that blends early rock and folk influences, *Fly By Night* has been praised for its inventive storytelling and emotional depth. The New York Post called it [“a winsome love triangle” with a “charming and catchy” score](https://nypost.com/2014/06/11/earnest-fly-by-night-will-enchant-audiences/), while The Dallas Morning News described it as “[hilarious and bittersweet](https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/2013/05/09/hot-show-fly-by-night-is-the-most-paradoxical-of-musicals/), deeply immersed in tradition but utterly original”.

At the heart of the show is a story of grief, love and connection. “[[production:2025 Fly By Night]] is truly the exploration of every character’s navigation of loss in their personal lives,” says director Sherrie Provence. “It looks deeply into the human condition and the need in every heart to be seen and find authentic connection.”

*Fly By Night* has developed a devoted following for its haunting score and deeply human storytelling. OnStage Blog recently named *Fly By Night* one of the [most underrated musicals of the past 25 years](https://www.onstageblog.com/editorials/2025/4/7/the-most-underrated-musicals-of-the-past-25-years). “It’s a musical about fate, sandwiches and grief,” wrote critic Chris Peterson. “Somehow, it works.” After listening to the cast album, he said, “I just sat in silence for a minute, like, what did I just experience? It's magic. Pure overlooked magic.” 

Though the musical features a love triangle, it’s not a traditional romance. Characters yearn to be understood and validated by others, even as the story gently questions whether that validation can — or should — come from within. Like a butterfly effect in motion, the smallest choices ripple forward with lasting consequences.

Performances are at 7:30 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays, with Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. A special preview performance is scheduled for May 8, and Limelight’s “Terrific Tuesday” discount night will take place on May 20.
