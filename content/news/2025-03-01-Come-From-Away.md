The show, scheduled for August 28 to October 5, had been promoted as a surprise addition for the theater's fall lineup.

Set in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, *Come From Away* shares the true story of how the residents of Gander, Newfoundland, welcomed about 7,000 stranded airline passengers into their small town. The musical is acclaimed for its emotional storytelling, memorable songs and powerful portrayal of human kindness during tragedy.

Craig Smith, managing partner at Alhambra Theatre & Dining, said the theater had been excitedly awaiting the opportunity to share this news.

"This is a show that captures the best of humanity," Smith said. "We're honored to bring this incredible story to our audiences."

Alhambra Theatre & Dining, located at 12000 Beach Blvd. in Jacksonville, is the longest-running dinner theater in the country. Tickets start at $48 and include a three-course dinner, the performance and parking.
