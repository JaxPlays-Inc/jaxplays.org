Actors and theatre companies from across Northeast Florida are preparing for the Fourth Annual First Coast Unified Auditions, set for Saturday, July 19 at Limelight Theatre in St. Augustine.<!--more-->

Organized as a “cattle call” event, the Unifieds offer a single-day opportunity for actors to audition for multiple theatres at once — a process that has become a popular resource for performers and a time-saving tool for theatre companies throughout the region. Eight organizations will attend this year: 
[[theatre:Alhambra Theatre and Dining]], [[theatre:City Repertory Theatre]], [[theatre:Clamour Theatre]], [[theatre:A Classic Theatre]], [[theatre:The Island Theater]], [[theatre:Limelight Theatre]], [[theatre:Orange Park Community Theatre]] and [[theatre:River City Players]].
Companies are sending a range of representatives, including artistic directors, technical staff, board members, choreographers and music directors.

The audition schedule starts at 10 a.m. with minors, who do not need to pre-register. Pre-registered adult auditions follow at 11 a.m. After a lunch break at noon, general walk-in auditions run from 1 to 4 p.m., with each participant allotted a five-minute slot. Pre-registration for adult slots has already closed, so remaining actors are invited to attend during the general session.

Actors are required to prepare either two contrasting monologues or one monologue and a 32-bar cut of a song. Ten copies of a headshot and résumé are also requested. The format is designed to allow performers to showcase a range of skills and give directors a broad sense of each candidate’s abilities.

Organizers describe the Unifieds as both a practical audition and a celebration of regional theatre. The event provides a venue for networking and collaboration, offering directors and performers a chance to build relationships that support future productions. “This isn’t just a day of auditions—it’s a celebration of the incredible talent that lives and grows in Northeast Florida,” said Sherrie Provence, executive director of Limelight Theatre. The First Coast Unified Auditions send "a powerful message that we’re all committed to working together, building each other up and nurturing the vibrant theater culture that defines our community.”

Directors attending the Unifieds will receive complimentary tickets to that night’s performance of Hairspray at Limelight Theatre, an added incentive that also encourages cross-company support and engagement.

The Unifieds have grown into an annual tradition, reflecting a spirit of cooperation among Northeast Florida theatres. Companies benefit from a wider pool of talent, while actors gain increased access to casting opportunities — often leading to new partnerships and expanded careers.
