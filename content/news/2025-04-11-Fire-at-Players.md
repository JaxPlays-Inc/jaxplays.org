A fire inside the [[venue:Grace Darling Studio Theatre|Studio Theatre]] at [[theatre:Players by the Sea]] has caused widespread water damage throughout the Jacksonville Beach venue, suspending all operations and programming until further notice.

According to an email and [Facebook post by Players by the Sea’s staff and board](https://www.facebook.com/playersbytheseatheatre/posts/pfbid0jD3w3cU2SAkbtZX2Y4MZCNzz6xpL4T3PXjDVdUQdtZ72TiyFnWc68s8aF7yVsyesl), the fire occurred while the facility was unoccupied. The sprinkler system activated as designed and successfully extinguished the blaze, but not before causing substantial water damage to the entire building. No injuries were reported.

"All operations and programming at Players by the Sea are suspended until further notice," the company wrote in a message to supporters. "We are currently assessing the full scope of the damage."

Bradley Akers, managing director of Players by the Sea, described the venue as more than just a performance space. "This building is a cultural landmark in Jacksonville Beach and beyond," he said. "For decades, it has served as an artistic home where our community experiences the power and impact of theatre and the arts." He added, "To say we’re devastated by the recent fire and resulting water damage is an understatement."

As Players celebrates its 60th season, Akers reflected on the theatre’s legacy of resilience. "Players by the Sea has weathered many storms, both literal and metaphorical, and this moment is no different," he said. "While the lights are out for now, this is merely a scene change. And soon, the lights will rise again on a beautiful new chapter in our story."

The fire also affected [[theatre:ABET - All Beaches Experimental Theatre]]’s planned performances of [[production:2025 Misery]], which was scheduled to open Friday evening in Players’ Studio Theatre. [Raines Carr, interim artistic director of ABET, notified patrons](https://www.abetjax.com/press) that this weekend’s performances are canceled. "Tickets or Flex Pass that were to be used this weekend will be honored for a future performance," he said.

In a personal message to the community, *Misery* director [Bryce Cofield shared his heartbreak](https://www.facebook.com/ABETtheatre/posts/pfbid02kn8aqR1uGD2SzwamYGgKNB8uKPrtskAm1zVUgraDYsTBbmCTwLT1qhXmQg3fiXm7l) over the loss, writing, "I’m devastated. For my cast. For my crew. For the organizations that called that theatre home." Still, he expressed hope in the face of uncertainty: "We’ll rise again. We’ll create again. Because that’s what artists do."

[[theatre:Greenlight Theatre Company]], another resident company at Players by the Sea, [expressed support following the fire](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02yYMhV6cKkeywcQEUPfuQpnfMejv5sPb9pMchi9JPSVQotUH8NgK8msiRaKQCwBkhl&id=100075552802465), calling the venue "a home for creativity, connection, and community." In a statement, the company said, "Our hearts go out to the entire Players team… and we stand with them as they begin the path toward recovery."

Players by the Sea and ABET have not yet announced the future of the rest of the run of *Misery* or other upcoming productions. Further updates are expected as damage assessments continue.
