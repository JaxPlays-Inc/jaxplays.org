**It’s showtime, Jacksonville!** Thanks to the [[theatre:FSCJ Artist Series]], the ghost with the most is materializing at the Jacksonville Center for the Performing Arts from **May 12–17, 2026**. This isn’t your average Broadway tour — [[production:2026 Beetlejuice]] is a wildly irreverent, hilariously unhinged, visually dazzling and surprisingly heartfelt musical adaptation of the 1988 Tim Burton classic that’s become a fan favorite in its own right.

### Plot twist: Lydia’s world takes the lead

While the original film centered around Beetlejuice’s antics, the stage version turns the spotlight toward Lydia Deetz, the death-obsessed teenager who feels more connected to the afterlife than the living. Following the sudden death of her mother, Lydia is stuck in a mansion with her clueless father and his equally clueless girlfriend — until she discovers she’s not the only one haunting the halls. Enter the recently deceased Maitlands, a sweet but boring couple, and Beetlejuice, a crass, fast-talking demon who’s dying (literally) for someone to say his name.

In this musical reimagining, Lydia’s grief becomes the emotional engine of the story. Her search for connection and closure brings unexpected depth to the supernatural comedy, making the show much more than a simple spookfest. It’s a clever, off-kilter coming-of-age tale wrapped in eye-popping visuals and wrapped tighter in fishnet than Beetlejuice’s striped suit.

### Songs to wake the dead

The music, written by Tony Award nominee [[w:Eddie Perfect]], is as bold and bizarre as the titular demon himself. Right out of the gate, Beetlejuice kicks things off with the hilarious and self-aware number "[The Whole ‘Being Dead’ Thing](https://song.link/i/1466050454)," a fourth-wall-breaking romp that sets the tone for the wild ride to come. Lydia’s gut-punch solo "[Dead Mom](https://song.link/i/1466050461)" channels real pain through a power-pop anthem, offering an emotional center that grounds the supernatural spectacle. 

Meanwhile, the duet "[Say My Name](https://song.link/i/1466050589)" is pure Broadway mischief as Lydia and Beetlejuice strike their twisted bargain. Of course, the iconic "[Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)](https://song.link/i/1466050593)" makes its triumphant return during the haunted dinner party scene, blending nostalgia with unhinged energy. Altogether, the score swings between laugh-out-loud irreverence and surprisingly sincere moments — just like the show itself.

### A visual spectacle from beyond

Critics and fans alike have raved about the show's bold visual design. With Tim Burton-inspired sets, jaw-dropping lighting, jaw-snapping sandworms and stagecraft wizardry that makes scenes disappear (and reappear) in a puff of green smoke, it’s easy to see why the production has been hailed as a **[“technical marvel beyond description.”](https://www.metrmag.com/latest-reviews/beetlejuice-the-musical-hanover-theatre-for-the-performing-arts-worcester-ma-review)** The show’s ability to turn a Broadway stage into a zany, haunted funhouse is nothing short of theatrical alchemy. 

### A cult hit with a pulse

Originally a slow burn on Broadway, *Beetlejuice* gained traction through a fiercely loyal online fanbase, eventually earning a second life (fittingly) after being resurrected post-pandemic. Critics have praised it for its emotional core, visual creativity and wildly charismatic performances. It’s become a Gen Z favorite — thanks to its viral social media presence and fan-forward marketing. And, it's a magnet for theatergoers who want something a little less buttoned-up and a lot more batty. 

And yes, **the humor is edgy**. The show’s script leans into PG-13 territory with cheeky innuendo, fourth-wall breaks and politically incorrect zingers that might make your grandma blush — but will leave most audiences howling.

### Don’t ghost this show

With only **eight performances** in Jacksonville, tickets are expected to vanish faster than Beetlejuice at a wedding. Reserve your spot now through the **[official FSCJ Artist Series website](https://www.fscjartistseries.org/)**.

*Beetlejuice* is weird, wild and full of heart. Whether you're a fan of the original film or new to the tale of Lydia and her supernatural companions, this is one musical you’ll be dying to see.

**Note:** *Given the mature themes and humor, parental discretion is advised for younger audience members.*
