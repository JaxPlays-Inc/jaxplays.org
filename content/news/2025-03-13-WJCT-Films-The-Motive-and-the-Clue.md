Jacksonville audiences will get an exclusive chance to experience a critically praised production from London’s renowned National Theatre with [WJCT Public Media’s screening of *The Motive and the Cue*](https://wjct.org/events/film/the-motive-and-the-cue/). The screening is set for March 19 at WJCT Studios.<!--more-->

Filmed live during its sold-out run at the National Theatre, *The Motive and the Cue*, explores the intense drama and creative clashes between legendary actor [[w:Richard Burton]] ([[w:Johnny Flynn]]) and esteemed director [[w:John Gielgud]] ([[w:Mark Gatiss]]) as they grapple fiercely over artistic vision while rehearsing a groundbreaking 1964 Broadway production of Hamlet. The story delves deeply into the creative friction between Burton's passionate, instinct-driven acting style and Gielgud’s disciplined, precise approach. As their rehearsals grow increasingly tense, Burton’s turbulent marriage to [[w:Elizabeth Taylor]] ([[w:Tuppence Middleton]]) adds emotional fuel to the already charged atmosphere. Directed by Academy Award winner [[w:Sam Mendes]] (*[[w:American Beauty]]*, *[[w:1917_(2019_film)|1917]]*) and penned by celebrated playwright [[w:Jack Thorne]] (*[[w:Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]*), this behind-the-scenes drama captures the complex relationships, raw emotions and artistic battles that transformed a classic Shakespearean tragedy into theatrical legend.

Critics have called the play “[a love letter to theatre](https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/theatre/sam-mendes-lebedev-award-evening-standard-theatre-awards-interview-b1122230.html)” (Evening Standard) and "[immaculately directed by Sam Mendes](https://www.thetimes.com/culture/theatre-dance/article/the-motive-and-the-cue-review-burton-and-gielgud-clash-in-battle-of-wits-sf75tth6d?region=global)" (The Times). The production captures the tension, passion and artistic struggles between Gielgud and Burton, giving audiences an intimate look at two giants of stage and screen in conflict over their visions for Shakespeare’s greatest tragedy.

David McGowan, president and CEO of WJCT Public Media, called the screening a unique opportunity to bring top-tier theatrical experiences to Jacksonville. “This partnership with the National Theatre and BY&nbsp;Experience allows us to showcase exceptional performances, and we're excited to offer this to our local arts community,” McGowan said. "*The Motive and the Cue* is the first of what we hope will be an important addition to our regional arts and culture scene, as we bring a series of acclaimed productions by one of the world’s most acclaimed theatre companies to Jacksonville."

The event takes place Wednesday, March 19, at WJCT Studios, 100 Festival Park Ave. Doors open at 6 p.m., and the three-hour screening begins at 7 p.m., including a 15-minute intermission. Tickets are $10, with refreshments, beer, wine and popcorn available for purchase.
