Acclaimed actor and director [[person:David Alford]] returns to the Jacksonville stage this summer to star in [[theatre:Lumen Repertory Theatre]]’s upcoming production of David Mamet’s [[production:2025 American Buffalo]]. The gritty three-man drama opens June 13 in the intimate black-box setting of [[venue:WJCT Studio B]].

Alford, a veteran of stage and screen, is known locally for his riveting performance in Lumen Rep’s 2024 production of [[production:2024 Slow Burn|The Zoo Story]]. [That role earned high praise from JaxPlays](/reviews/2024/07/13/theatrical-mastery-in-lumen-reps-slow-burn-questions-cultural-constructs/), which described his work as “deeply engaging and flawless,” adding that “his mere expressions steal the show.” His portrayal of Peter was lauded for its emotional precision — “every wince is felt by the audience.”

Now, Alford takes on the role of Walter “Teach” Cole, a volatile hustler at the heart of Mamet’s sharply drawn tale of loyalty, ambition and moral collapse. He joins Lumen Rep co-founder [[person:Brian Niece]], who plays Donny Dubrow, and [[person:Joshua Britton Andrews]] as Bobby.

In a cluttered Chicago junk shop, Donny, a weary store owner, teams up with his brash friend Teach and a young, uncertain protege named Bobby to steal a rare coin they believe was unfairly sold. But as tensions rise and loyalties fray, their plan crumbles into suspicion and violence. *American Buffalo* lays bare the fragile dynamics between these three men, exposing the quiet desperation that drives them and the harsh realities of trust, ambition and survival in a cutthroat world.

Co-directed by Niece and [[person:Tyler Hammond]], *American Buffalo* is the second production in Lumen’s “Subversive Season,” following [[production:2025 Agnes of God]]. The company continues its mission to present challenging, thought-provoking theatre while offering artists the protections, fair pay and professional working conditions associated with Equity productions.

“*American Buffalo* continues our Subversive Season’s commitment to theatre that confronts human desire and ethical ambiguity,” Niece said in a statement.

Alford’s return further underscores Lumen Rep’s growing reputation as a haven for professional artists. Best known for his work on ABC’s *[Nashville](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2281375/)* and for his plays *[Spirit: The Authentic Story of the Bell Witch of Tennessee](https://bellwitchfallfestival.com/our-shows/spirit/)* and *[Smoke: A Ballad of the Night Riders](https://bellwitchfallfestival.com/our-shows/smoke/)*, Alford also directed Lumen’s [[production:2024 SLOW BURN|American Dream]] last year.

[[production:2025 American Buffalo]] runs June 13 through 28. Tickets are $45, with [free admission for high-school and college students through the NEXTGEN program](/news/2025/03/04/lumen-rep-offers-free-theatre-admission-to-high-school-students-for-2025-season/).
