Five-time Olivier Award winner Imelda Staunton (The Crown) stars alongside her daughter, Bessie Carter (Bridgerton), in George Bernard Shaw’s sharp and still-relevant drama about morality, independence and social hypocrisy. Directed by Dominic Cooke (Follies, Good), the production was filmed live from London’s West End and captures the energy of the stage on screen.
