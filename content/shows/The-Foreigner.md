Description: "Laugh out loud with 'The Foreigner,' a hilarious comedy by Larry Shue that turns a simple misunderstanding into a whirlwind of mistaken identities and farcical situations."
---
When shy Englishman Charlie Baker finds himself at a rural Georgia fishing lodge, he pretends to be a foreigner who doesn’t understand English to avoid conversation. This ruse leads to a series of comedic misunderstandings as the lodge’s quirky inhabitants reveal their secrets and schemes in his presence. As Charlie becomes an unwitting hero, he discovers his own courage and resourcefulness.
