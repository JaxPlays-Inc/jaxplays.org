*Elf* follows the story of Buddy, a human raised unknowingly as an elf at the North Pole. Discovering his true origins, he heads to New York City to seek out his biological father, a cynical businessman. Along the way, Buddy experiences the realities of human life, spreading his infectious joy and the true spirit of Christmas to everyone he meets. This musical adaptation of the popular film brings to the stage a festive blend of humor, charm, and the message that the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.
