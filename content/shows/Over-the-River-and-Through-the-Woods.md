"Over the River and Through the Woods" is a charming, warm-hearted comedy written by Joe DiPietro. The story revolves around Nick, a single Italian-American from New Jersey who has dinner with both sets of his grandparents every Sunday. The routine and his familial bonds are threatened when Nick is offered a dream job across the country. The news doesn't sit well with his grandparents who, in a series of funny and touching efforts, plot to keep Nick from leaving. Exploring themes of family, tradition, and the generational gap, the play is a delightful mixture of humor and sentimentality, underlining the importance and value of family ties and cultural roots.
