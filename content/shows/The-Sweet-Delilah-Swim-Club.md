---
*The Sweet Delilah Swim Club* follows the lives of five diverse Southern women who met years ago on their college swim team. Every August, they set aside a long weekend to recharge and reconnect at a beach cottage on North Carolina's Outer Banks. Over three decades, these weekends become a repository of shared experiences: marriages, divorces, childbirths and life's inevitable challenges. Through laughter and tears, the play beautifully explores the strength of friendship that deepens with time, demonstrating how these annual gatherings become essential touchstones in each woman's life.
