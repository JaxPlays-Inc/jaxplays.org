Tired of being pushed around and overlooked, three female office workers concoct a plan to get even with the chauvinistic, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot they call their boss. As they take control of the company, their lives start to change for the better. But how long can they keep their newfound freedom? Based on the hit 1980 movie, this hilarious musical romp features a jubilant score by the one and only Dolly Parton.
