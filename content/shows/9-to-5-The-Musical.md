Tired of being pushed around and overlooked, three female office workers concoct a plan to get even with the chauvinistic, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot they call their boss. As they take control of the company, their lives start to change for the better. But how long can they keep their newfound freedom? Based on the hit 1980 movie, this hilarious musical romp features a jubilant score by the one and only Dolly Parton.

*9 to 5: The Musical* is a lively and engaging stage production that brings the humorous and empowering story of three working women to life. Set in the corporate world of the late 1970s, the musical follows the journey of Violet Newstead, Judy Bernly, and Doralee Rhodes as they navigate the challenges and frustrations of their male-dominated workplace.

Inspired by the iconic 1980 film, the musical is underscored by the music and lyrics of Dolly Parton, who also starred in the original movie. As these three women band together against their overbearing boss, Franklin Hart, Jr., their individual strengths and unique personalities shine. Through witty humor and catchy tunes, the musical addresses issues of workplace inequality, gender roles, and the pursuit of personal aspirations.
