*The Sunshine Boys* follows the cantankerous vaudeville duo Willie Clark and Al Lewis—once a famous comedy team, now estranged after years of grudges and miscommunication. When a television special reunites them for one last performance, their decades-old feud reignites with hilarious and heartfelt results.  

Written by Neil Simon, the play is a witty and tender look at friendship, aging, and the enduring power of laughter. This timeless comedy showcases Simon’s trademark sharp dialogue and emotional depth as two stubborn entertainers rediscover the meaning of partnership and forgiveness.
