Description: "Pink, perky and packed with pep, Elle Woods takes the courtroom by storm, proving you can solve legal conundrums in style."
---
When her dreamy boyfriend dumps her for someone 'serious,' fashion-obsessed sorority girl Elle Woods decides to show she's no airhead. She aces the LSATs and enrolls at Harvard Law School. While law school is a far cry from the comforts of her poolside mansion and the mall, Elle fights to win her ex back by proving she's more than just a pretty face. Along the way, she discovers her true potential and tackles stereotypes, snobbery, and scandal in the courtroom.
