*Hamlet* centers on Prince Hamlet of Denmark, who is thrown into emotional turmoil after the ghost of his murdered father reveals that Hamlet’s uncle, now king, is the killer. Wrestling with betrayal, morality, and the nature of existence, Hamlet plots to expose the truth and take revenge. Along the way, he alienates those closest to him, questions the purpose of life, and descends into feigned — or perhaps genuine — madness. Shakespeare’s iconic tragedy explores themes of grief, power, loyalty, and the paralyzing burden of action through some of the most famous lines in literature.
