*Noises Off* presents a play-within-a-play, 'Nothing's On,' a mediocre farce where the real drama unfolds backstage. As the actors attempt to manage their personal relationships and professional mishaps, the boundaries between their lives on and off stage blur into uproarious scenarios. With doors slamming, missed cues, and sardines flying, the cast spirals towards a disastrous but wildly funny climax. This comedy by Michael Frayn is a delightful critique of the theatrical world, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the mishaps and mayhem of putting on a play.
