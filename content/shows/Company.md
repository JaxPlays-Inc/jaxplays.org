---
*Company* follows Robert (Bobby), a single man living in New York City on his 35th birthday, surrounded by couples who are his best friends. Through a series of vignettes, Bobby interacts with these married friends and three girlfriends, each relationship presenting a different perspective on the meaning of companionship. The musical is a thoughtful and witty examination of love, commitment, and what it means to be alone in a world where societal norms dictate forming relationships. With Stephen Sondheim’s brilliant score, *Company* delves into the essence of human connection and the pursuit of happiness in contemporary life.
