*The Sound of Music* tells the uplifting story of Maria, a spirited young woman who leaves an Austrian convent to become a governess to the seven children of a strict widower, Captain von Trapp. As Maria introduces music and laughter back into the family's home, her charm and kindness win the hearts of the children and their initially reluctant father. Set against the onset of World War II, the musical highlights themes of love, courage, and resilience. With memorable songs like "Edelweiss," "My Favorite Things" and "Climb Ev'ry Mountain," this timeless story celebrates the transformative power of music and the spirit of human endurance.
