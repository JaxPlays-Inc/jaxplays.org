Description: "When love sparks between Alice Sycamore and Tony Kirby, it's more than just a union of two soulsâ€”it's a collision of two wildly different families. Alice hails from a household of eccentrics who march to the beat of their own drums, while Tony is the scion of a Wall Street clan obsessed with status and wealth."

As Alice and Tony's engagement leads to an inevitable meeting of their respective families, chaos unfolds. This Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy serves as a timeless testament to the beauty of individuality, the importance of nonconformity, and the ultimate futility of the rat race. Witness the chaos, the romance, and the heartfelt laughs as you discover that, in the end, you truly can't take it with you."
