*The Glass Menagerie* is a semi-autobiographical “memory play” that centers on Tom Wingfield, who recalls his life with his overbearing mother, Amanda, and his painfully shy sister, Laura. Amanda clings to her faded Southern belle past, while Laura retreats into a world of fragile glass animals. Pressured by Amanda to secure a “gentleman caller” for Laura, Tom brings home a co-worker, Jim, who offers a fleeting glimpse of hope before reality intrudes once more. Williams’ lyrical masterpiece blends memory and illusion to explore themes of escape, obligation, and the fragility of dreams.
