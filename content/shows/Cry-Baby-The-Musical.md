Based on John Waters' cult classic film, *Cry-Baby: The Musical* tells the story of Wade "Cry-Baby" Walker, a dashing delinquent with the ability to make girls swoon. When he falls for the rich, beautiful, and decidedly square Allison Vernon-Williams, their romance sparks a battle between the drapes and the squares in 1950s Baltimore. Packed with electrifying music and exuberant dance numbers, this musical breaks all the rules of a typical love story with its delightful humor and vibrant characters.
