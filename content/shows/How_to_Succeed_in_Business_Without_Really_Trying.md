Through a combination of charm, cunning, and a series of fortunate events, Finch quickly rises from the mailroom to the executive suite, outwitting his rivals along the way. However, his rapid ascent attracts scrutiny and puts his career, as well as his romantic relationship with secretary Rosemary Pilkington, on the line.
