J. Pierrepont Finch, a young window washer, discovers a book titled "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" and decides to follow its advice to ascend the corporate hierarchy. Through a combination of charm, cunning, and a series of fortunate events, Finch quickly rises from the mailroom to the executive suite, outwitting his rivals along the way. However, his rapid ascent attracts scrutiny and puts his career, as well as his romantic relationship with secretary Rosemary Pilkington, on the line. Through catchy tunes and comedic twists, the musical explores the absurdities of corporate life, touching on themes like nepotism, ethics, and the pursuit of the American Dream.
