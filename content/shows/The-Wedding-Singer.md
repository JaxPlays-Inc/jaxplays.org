Description: "Step back into the neon-soaked '80s with *The Wedding Singer*, where love songs, heartbreak, and hairdos collide in this upbeat musical comedy."
---
Robbie Hart, New Jersey's favorite wedding singer, is the life of the party until his own fiancée leaves him at the altar. Heartbroken and cynical, he begins to sabotage weddings with his morose performances. That is until he meets Julia, a sweet waitress who wins his heart. But Julia is set to marry a Wall Street shark, and Robbie must pull off the performance of a decade to win her love. Packed with infectious tunes, big laughs, and even bigger hair, *The Wedding Singer* is a nostalgic trip to the '80s with a romantic twist.
