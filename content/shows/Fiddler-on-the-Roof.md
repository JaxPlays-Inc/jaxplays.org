---
*Fiddler on the Roof* is a classic Broadway musical that takes place in the small Jewish village of Anatevka, Russia, in the early 20th century. The story primarily follows Tevye, a poor milkman, as he strives to maintain his family's Jewish traditions amidst the swirling winds of societal change. Tevye grapples with the strong-willed actions of his three eldest daughters—Tzeitel, Hodel, and Chava—who each choose their own husbands in ways that challenge age-old customs. Their choices and Tevye's reactions reflect the struggle between tradition and progress. Meanwhile, the looming threat of anti-Jewish sentiment and violence adds another layer of tension to the narrative. The show features iconic songs like "Tradition," "Matchmaker, Matchmaker," "If I Were A Rich Man," and "Sunrise, Sunset," which have become fixtures in the canon of American musical theatre. Since its premiere on Broadway in 1964, *Fiddler on the Roof*, with its evocative themes and memorable music, has seen multiple revivals and remains a beloved staple in the world of theatre.
