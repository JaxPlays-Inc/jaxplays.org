Description: "Journey down the yellow brick road with Dorothy, a Kansas farm girl, as she navigates the fantastical world of Oz."
---
Whisked away by a tornado, Dorothy finds herself in the whimsical world of Oz. With her dog Toto and new-found friends—the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion—she sets off to meet the Wizard to find a way home. Along the way, they battle the Wicked Witch of the West and discover that true magic lies within themselves. There's no place like home, but Oz is a whirlwind of its own.
