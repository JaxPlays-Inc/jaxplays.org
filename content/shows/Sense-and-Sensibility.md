Description: "Dive into the genteel world of the Dashwood sisters in 'Sense and Sensibility,' a tale of love, heartbreak, and resilience in Regency England."
---
After the death of their father, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood face sudden financial instability and social displacement. As the sisters navigate through the complex social mores of the time, Elinor's sense clashes with Marianne's sensibility, especially in matters of the heart. The Dashwoods' journey through love, betrayal, and secrets tests their bond and ultimately teaches them about the importance of both reason and emotion in their lives. Adapted from Jane Austen's beloved novel, this play elegantly captures the trials and triumphs of navigating love and society in the 19th century."
