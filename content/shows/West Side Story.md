Description: It's more than a turf warâ€”it's an iconic retelling of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, but with dance-offs and jazz hands.

In the streets of 1950s New York City, two rival gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, battle for control. Amid the chaos, Tony, a Jet, and Maria, the sister of the Sharks' leader, fall hopelessly in love. As tensions rise, the star-crossed lovers must navigate prejudice, loyalty, and the dire consequences of forbidden love, all to a Sondheim score that'll make you snap your fingers.
