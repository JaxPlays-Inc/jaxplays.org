*Our Town* unfolds in the early 20th century in the fictional American town of Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. Through the everyday activities of the Webb and Gibbs families, the play offers a profound reflection on the simplicity and complexity of ordinary life. Narrated by the Stage Manager, who also interacts with the audience and characters, the story moves through three acts focusing on daily life, love, and death. Thornton Wilderâ€™s minimalist stage setting directs attention to the dialogue and actor performances, emphasizing themes of community, mortality, and the fleeting nature of time.
