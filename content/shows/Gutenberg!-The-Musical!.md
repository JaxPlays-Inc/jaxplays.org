*Gutenberg! The Musical!* follows Bud and Doug, two enthusiastic but clueless aspiring writers, as they present a backer’s audition for their new musical about the inventor of the printing press. With nothing but boundless energy, dozens of labeled trucker hats and questionable historical accuracy, they perform every role themselves. The result is an outrageous parody of big Broadway dreams, filled with overblown songs, misguided storytelling and the earnest belief that their masterpiece will change the world.
