*Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella* is a magical rendition of the classic fairy tale, enhanced with the legendary duo’s musical brilliance. This version introduces us to a more dynamic Cinderella who not only wishes for a better life but actively pursues it with courage and kindness. The story unfolds with Cinderella's transformation by her Fairy Godmother, her enchanting evening at the royal ball, and the iconic glass slipper incident. However, it's her grace, intelligence, and compassion that captivate the prince and the audience alike. With memorable songs like "In My Own Little Corner" and "Impossible; It's Possible," the musical celebrates the power of dreams and the spirit of hope that resonates with all ages.
