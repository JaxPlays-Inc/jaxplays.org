*Little Women* follows the lives of four sisters—Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March—growing up in Civil War-era America. Under the guidance of their beloved mother, Marmee, while their father is away at war, the girls navigate what it means to be a young woman: from sibling rivalry and first love to loss and marriage. This adaptation brings to life the enduring resilience and love that bind the March family together against the backdrop of a changing America.
