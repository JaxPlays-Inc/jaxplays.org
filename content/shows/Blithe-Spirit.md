*Blithe Spirit* centers on Charles Condomine, a writer researching the occult for his next book. Inviting eccentric medium Madame Arcati to conduct a séance, he inadvertently conjures the spirit of his late wife, Elvira. Much to the dismay of his current wife, Ruth, Elvira delights in disrupting Charles’s life, leading to increasingly absurd and spectral complications. Noël Coward’s witty dialogue and sharp humor make this supernatural farce a classic, blending marital satire with ghostly mischief.
