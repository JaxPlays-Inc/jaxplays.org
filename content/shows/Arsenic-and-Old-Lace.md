Arsenic and Old Lace" is a classic comedic play that combines farce, dark humor, and a touch of murder mystery. Set in the 1940s, the story revolves around the eccentric Brewster family. Mortimer Brewster, a theater critic, discovers that his charming, elderly aunts, Abby and Martha, have a peculiar habit of poisoning lonely old men as an act of charity. To complicate matters, Mortimer's brother Teddy believes he is Theodore Roosevelt and graves in the basement are the Panama Canal.

As Mortimer attempts to deal with his aunts' macabre secret, his other brother, the sinister Jonathan, returns home with his accomplice, Dr. Einstein. Chaos ensues as the brothers try to keep their dark secrets hidden from the prying eyes of neighbors and the law, leading to hilarious misunderstandings and absurd situations.

"Arsenic and Old Lace" is a delightful blend of black comedy, witty dialogue, and slapstick humor, with a suspenseful undercurrent that keeps the audience engaged. It is a timeless theatrical gem that continues to entertain audiences with its eccentric characters, fast-paced humor, and twisted yet amusing plot twists.
