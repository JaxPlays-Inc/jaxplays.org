*Young Frankenstein* brings to life the story of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, who inherits his infamous grandfather's estate and finds himself in the mad scientist shoes he once shunned. Determined to succeed where his grandfather failed, Frederick revives the experiment in a hilarious tour-de-force, complete with singing monsters, dancing lab assistants and the legendary Frau Blücher.
