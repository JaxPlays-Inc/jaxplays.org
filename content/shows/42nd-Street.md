---
Set during the Great Depression, the story unfolds as Peggy Sawyer, a talented but naive young dancer from Allentown, Pennsylvania, arrives in New York City with stars in her eyes. She lands a spot in the chorus line of "Pretty Lady," a new Broadway musical directed by the renowned but demanding Julian Marsh. When the showâ€™s leading lady is injured, Peggy gets the break of a lifetime to lead the production, which must succeed to restore financial stability to all involved. Through spectacular dance numbers and iconic songs like "Lullaby of Broadway" and "42nd Street," the musical captures the essence of Broadway's golden age and the relentless spirit of those who populate it.
