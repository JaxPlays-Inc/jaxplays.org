In Agatha Christie's masterful mystery, a group of strangers find themselves trapped in a British guesthouse during a snowstorm, only to learn that one among them is a murderer. As the guests get to know each other, secrets emerge and alibis weaken, making everyone a suspect. It's a race against time to identify the killer before they strike again. *The Mousetrap* holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-running play and promises an evening of edge-of-your-seat suspense.
