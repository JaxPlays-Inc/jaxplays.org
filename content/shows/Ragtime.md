*Ragtime* is a powerful and sweeping musical based on the novel of the same name by E.L. Doctorow, with a book by Terrence McNally. Set in the early 20th century, the story weaves together the lives of three distinct groups of characters: an upper-class white family, an African American couple, and a Jewish immigrant father and his daughter. Against the backdrop of historical events and social upheaval, including racial tensions and the struggle for women's rights, their lives become intertwined as they navigate the rapidly changing American landscape.

Through its vibrant and diverse score, incorporating ragtime music, the musical captures the spirit and essence of the era. With themes of love, hope, injustice, and the pursuit of the American Dream, *Ragtime* explores the complexities of identity and the resilience of the human spirit.
