Dive into the wild world of the late '80s on the Sunset Strip, where a small-town girl meets a big-city rocker at LA’s most famous rock club. Their romance unfolds to the greatest hits of the decade, including songs from Journey, Styx, REO Speedwagon, Foreigner, Pat Benatar, and Whitesnake. Amidst the madness, an aspiring rock star dreams of stardom while fighting to save the venue from demolition. *Rock of Ages* is a raucous, heartfelt journey through the dreams, love and loud music that defined an era.
