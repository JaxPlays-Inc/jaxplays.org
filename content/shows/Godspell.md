*Godspell* is a renowned musical composed by Stephen Schwartz with the book by John-Michael Tebelak. First premiered in 1971, the show features a series of parables primarily based on the Gospel of Matthew, interspersed with a variety of modern music set primarily to lyrics from traditional hymns.

The structure of the musical is unique, as it lacks a traditional linear plot. Instead, it uses an episodic approach to present the teachings of Jesus Christ, emphasized through song, dance, and a range of theatrical styles. The show is known for its flexibility in presentation, often encouraging local adaptations and improvisation.

The score of *Godspell* is diverse, including pop, folk rock, gospel, and vaudeville styles, and features the popular hit "Day by Day." The musical's themes of community, love, and positivity, combined with its innovative format and memorable music, have led to its enduring popularity in professional theatre, community theatre, and school productions.

*Godspell* originally opened off-Broadway in May 1971 and has since been produced in various formats, including a 1973 film adaptation, and numerous revivals worldwide. Its unique interpretation of Biblical teachings and its engaging, relatable format have contributed significantly to its status as a seminal work in the world of musical theatre.
