*A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum* is a classic musical comedy that brings the infectious energy of slapstick humor to ancient Rome. The story follows Pseudolus, a crafty slave who struggles to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot thickens with mistaken identities, sly tricks and a series of comical deceptions. Stephen Sondheim's witty lyrics and catchy tunes, including 'Comedy Tonight,' add to the festive atmosphere as Pseudolus maneuvers through chaotic situations in his quest for freedom. This uproarious show combines elements of traditional farce with a modern sensibility, making it a perennial favorite.
