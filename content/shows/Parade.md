*Parade* tells the true and heart-wrenching story of Leo Frank, a Jewish factory manager falsely accused of murdering a young female employee in 1913 Atlanta. The musical chronicles his trial and the subsequent lynching, amidst a backdrop of anti-Semitism and social tumult. Through a powerful score by Jason Robert Brown, *Parade* examines themes of love, injustice and resilience. As Leo and his wife Lucille struggle to fight for his innocence against overwhelming odds, they also find a profound sense of love and solidarity in the face of adversity.
