*Puffs, or Seven Increasingly Eventful Years at a Certain School of Magic and Magic* offers a fresh and comedic take on a familiar wizarding world by shifting the focus to the underdogs: the Puffs. Across seven school years, the play follows a group of misfit students as they navigate spells, potions, battles and the chaos that always seems to surround a boy wizard who isnâ€™t them. With tongue-in-cheek humor, rapid-fire jokes and affectionate parody, *Puffs* celebrates those who never quite made the spotlight but had their own heroic adventures all the same.
