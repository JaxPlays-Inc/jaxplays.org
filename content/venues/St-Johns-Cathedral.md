St. John's Cathedral is a historical landmark situated atop Billy Goat Hill, the highest geographical point in the original city limits of Jacksonville. As a congregation deeply rooted in the heart of the city, the Cathedral has been instrumental in various ministries, extending its outreach to the homeless, children, and the elderly. With an emphasis on promoting the arts, education, and healthcare, St. John's Cathedral is committed to creating a vibrant, diverse neighborhood around Billy Goat Hill.

A standout feature of the Cathedral is The Great Organ, a majestic instrument that has undergone multiple renovations and expansions since its first installation in the 1880s. Currently boasting 76 ranks of pipes and 46 digital ranks in its grand 4-manual console, the organ is an auditory spectacle ideal for a range of musical stylesâ€”from the French School of organ performance to the compositions of J.S. Bach. Presided over by Timothy Tuller, Canon for Music, the Great Organ serves not only to accompany the choir but also to lead the congregation in hymns, playing a crucial role in the Cathedral's rich musical heritage. With a replacement cost estimated at over $2 million as of 2017, the organ is meticulously maintained through a dedicated endowment fund, ensuring its grandeur for years to come.
