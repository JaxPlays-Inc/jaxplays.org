The Florida Ballet relocated to the former YMCA space at 10131 Atlantic Boulevard in Arlington in 2019. The organization purchased the 3.35-acre site and 28,504-square-foot building for $1.55 million, moving from its previous location at 300 E. State St. in Downtown. The relocation was made to accommodate the growth of the program and to provide the organization with more space, parking, and resources to meet the evolving needs of the ballet community. 

On January 6, 2023, [The 5 & Dime Theatre Co.](/theatres/The_5_and_Dime/) announced that the Florida Ballet will The 5 & Dime as its Theatre Company in Residence for the entire 2023 Season. The residency will provide The 5 & Dime with performance space for all its productions, as well as rehearsal, office, and warehouse/shop space. This marks a significant step for The 5 & Dime as it transitions out of its nomadic phase and establishes a home base. The Florida Ballet has been a gracious host for The 5 & Dime since the 2021 Short Attention Span Festival and its kindness, generosity, and passion has made many of its endeavors possible. With this residency, The 5 & Dime looks forward to what the future holds and invites everyone to visit its new home once it's fully moved in.
