Nestled in Amelia Island, Florida, the Amelia Musical Playhouse (AMP) is more than just a theater; it's a community hub for artistic expression. Founded by Jill and Gregg Dillingham, the venue emerged from humble beginnings—a group of singers gathering around a piano—to become a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Known for its "organic scheduling," AMP thrives on the creative input of its all-volunteer team, offering opportunities for people of all ages and skill levels.

Housed in a building affectionately known as "The Octagon," the playhouse transformed from a rundown bar into a cozy, vibrant space for live performances. With a track record of over 140 shows since 2013, including more than 60 full-scale musicals, AMP showcases a wide array of musicals, plays, and revues.
