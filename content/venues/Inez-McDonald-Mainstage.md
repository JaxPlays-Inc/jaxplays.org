The [[theatre:Limelight Theatre]], a non-profit community theatre in St. Augustine, Florida, found its first permanent home in 2001 when it purchased a 10,000 square foot building on Old Mission Avenue with a grant from the Joukowsky Family Foundation. The building was converted into the 125-seat then-named Matuza Mainstage, allowing the theatre to expand its programming beyond rented spaces around St. Augustine. The Limelight Theatre received a Cultural Facilities Grant of $398,000 from the State of Florida in 2006, which funded significant improvements to the building, including a new roof, air-conditioning, heating, sound and lighting systems, lobby and restroom renovations, and the creation of a black box space called the [[venue:Koger-Gamache Studio Theatre]] that seats 75-90 people. 

The Matuza Mainstage was renamed to the Inez McDonald Mainstage in 2024 in honor of Inez McDonald, a long-time supporter and benefactor of the Limelight Theatre.
