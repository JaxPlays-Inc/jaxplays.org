Since its inception, The 5 & Dime has staged as few as two and as many as 12 productions in a season, often on borrowed or rented stages. In 2017, the company opened its own venue on Adams Street in downtown Jacksonville, providing a permanent home for its productions. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, The 5 & Dime made the difficult decision to go without a home stage.
