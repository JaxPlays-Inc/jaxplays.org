Riverside House, situated in Jacksonville's historic Riverside/Avondale neighborhood, serves as the headquarters for the Junior League of Jacksonville. Opening to the public in December 1980, this historic venue, originally a church from the 1920s, offers various spaces for events. These include a boardroom, auditorium, reception hall, and kitchen, all available at affordable rates. The auditorium, previously a church sanctuary, seats 283 people and comes with an audio/PA system. The reception room can accommodate up to 125 people with tables and chairs, or 140 with chairs only. The venue also features a bride's room and a fully equipped kitchen, making it ideal for weddings, receptions, meetings, and other events.
