The Temple Theatre, originally opened as the Duval Theater on August 30, 1904, was located at 221 N. Main St. in Jacksonville. Marketed early on as “Jacksonville’s best and coolest playhouse,” it hosted acts like operatic soprano Nellie Melba and “the idol of the South,” Mabel Paige, who starred in a 1910 production of *In the Palace of the King*. The theater, which had 1,250 seats at the time, was known for its affordable ticket prices — 10, 20 and 30 cents.

Renamed the Temple Theatre following a remodel, it reopened August 1, 1926 with a capacity of 1,350. Over the years, it served many civic and cultural roles, from dance recitals — including an early appearance by Eleanor King in 1925 — to hosting Duval High School’s 1927 graduation. It also presented lectures, like a 1928 series by Madame Ida Chjernoff, and stage works such as Naughty Marietta in 1929.

Though it closed briefly in 1930, the Temple remained active into the postwar years as a vaudeville house, even as the format faded. It became part of the Florida State Theatre circuit in 1942 and was still open in 1950, though seating had been reduced to 1,250. Eventually demolished, a parking lot now occupies the site where the theater once stood.
