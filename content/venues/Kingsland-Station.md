Kingsland Station is home to The Florida-Georgia Railway Heritage Museum INC., a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization powered by The Georgia Coastal Railway. We are dedicated to preserving railroad history through education, exhibits and entertainment. Proceeds from shows and train rides help to educate the public and to build and maintain our railroad heritage museum. Kingsland Station is also home to our new indoor theater where live performances take place. We are also dedicated to the youth in our community and present a free children’s theater program each summer.
