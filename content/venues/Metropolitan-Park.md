Metropolitan Park in Jacksonville, Florida, is a well-known public park located on the north bank of the St. Johns River. It opened in 1984, designed to serve as the city's premier urban waterfront park. Over the years, Metropolitan Park hosted a variety of major events and concerts, drawing both locals and visitors to its scenic riverfront views.

The park notably included an amphitheater, which became a favorite venue for outdoor concerts and festivals, enhancing Jacksonville's cultural scene. However, [Metropolitan Park's role as a venue came to an end when its amphitheater was torn down in 2016.](https://news.wjct.org/community/2016-04-12/city-shuts-down-met-park-ampitheatre-over-safety-concerns)
