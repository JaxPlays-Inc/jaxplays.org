Named after Preben Johansen.  Located between West Park and East Park Terraces, Johansen Park is a 12-acre passive park in the Selva Marina neighborhood. Just blocks from the ocean, Johansen has a canopy of trees and grassy areas for picnicking.

This park hosts the Spring Arts in the Park with food and music and displays from many local artists; Shakespeare in the Park: Beaches WellFest; and the AB Jazz Festival. It also has an official City Heritage Tree.
