The C. Herman & Mary Virginia Terry Theater is an intimate 600-seat venue within the Jacksonville Center for the Performing Arts, located at 300 West Water Street in downtown Jacksonville . It's designed for smaller-scale performances like poetry readings, dance recitals and comedy shows.

As part of the larger complex—which also includes the Moran Theater and Jacoby Symphony Hall—the Terry Theater offers a more personal setting for audiences and performers alike. It's a popular choice for touring comedians, local productions and community events .
