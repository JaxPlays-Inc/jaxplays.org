The Bier Hall at Intuition Ale Works, established in November 2019, is a dedicated live music venue located in the heart of Downtown Jacksonville. Born from Intuition's passion for combining great beer with live music, this 6,000-square-foot space was the vision of the late legendary promoter Tib Miller. Miller aimed to introduce new artists to the Jacksonville scene, making The Bier Hall a hotspot for both local and touring bands. The venue's creation was inspired by the brewery's initial success with hosting concerts after moving to Bay Street in 2016.
