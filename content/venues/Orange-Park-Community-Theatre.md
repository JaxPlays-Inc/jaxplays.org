The venue at 2900 Moody Avenue is the current home of the Orange Park Community Theatre. The facility was originally St. Marys Catholic Church that was donated to OPCT by Mrs. Virginia Mims in 1986, and the theatre group moved into the space in April 1987. The venue features a stage, seating area, lighting and sound equipment, and dressing rooms for performers. It is a cozy and intimate space that can accommodate a small audience, making it perfect for community theatre productions.
