The Linda Matuza Blackbox is a studio performance space located within the [[theatre:Limelight Theatre]] in St. Augustine, Florida. The theater has a seating capacity of 75-90 people and offers a versatile space for experimental, intimate, and contemporary performances. The space features state-of-the-art lighting and sound systems, as well as flexible seating arrangements that allow for various staging configurations. The Linda Matuza Blackbox is an important addition to the Limelight Theatre's facilities, providing a smaller venue for more intimate productions and expanding the theater's programming capabilities.

The Limelight Theatre received a Cultural Facilities Grant of $398,000 from the State of Florida in 2006, which funded significant improvements to the building including the creation of the black box space then called the [[venue:Koger-Gamache Studio Theatre]]. The Koger-Gamache Studio Theatre was renamed the Linda Matuza Blackbox in 2024 in honor of Linda Matuza, a long-time supporter and benefactor of the Limelight Theatre.
