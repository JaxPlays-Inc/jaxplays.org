The Florida Theatre is an historic American movie theater located in Jacksonville, Florida. Opened in 1927, it is one of the few remaining high-style movie palaces built in the 1920s in the Mediterranean Revival style. With its elaborate, Rococo-style interior and distinctive marquee featuring a prominent neon-lit nameplate, the theatre presents a majestic facade. Beyond its main auditorium, which seats 1,900 guests, the theatre contains a variety of spaces, including a charming mezzanine level, with an intimate setting perfect for smaller events. The Florida Theatre hosts a diverse range of events, from concerts and ballets to stand-up comedy and classic film screenings, carrying forward its legacy as a cultural beacon in downtown Jacksonville.
