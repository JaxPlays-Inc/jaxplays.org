Situated in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, the Ponte Vedra Concert Hall is an exceptional multi-purpose venue managed by the St. Johns County Cultural Events Division. Renowned for hosting a diverse lineup of over 140 performances and events each year, the hall is a sought-after destination for artists.

The venue's design is both versatile and innovative, capable of accommodating either 450 seated guests or up to 900 standing attendees. Whether it's hosting iconic rock musicians one evening or stand-up comedians the next, the hall is a dynamic space for a variety of performances.

Built in 2011, the hall carries a unique historical resonance. It was constructed on the foundation of a former Baptist church, and its renovation has transformed the space into a modern, yet historically enriched, entertainment venue. This blend of past and present provides a distinct backdrop for both performers and audiences.
