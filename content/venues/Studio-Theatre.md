The Studio Theatre offers a more intimate setting within the Nathan H. Wilson Center for the Arts. Specifically designed for smaller audiences, this versatile space hosts a wide range of events, from experimental theatre and intimate performances to business meetings and social gatherings, all complemented by the adjacent Conference Center.

The Nathan H. Wilson Center for the Arts is a comprehensive performing and visual arts facility located at Florida State College at Jacksonville's South Campus, serving both students and the wider community. The two-story lobby, housed in glass, leads patrons to the art gallery and main proscenium theater with 500 seats, as well as the studio theater designed for smaller audiences and the Conference Center available for business meetings, fundraisers, and social gatherings. The center's programming includes a variety of offerings such as opera, dance, multidisciplinary productions that integrate visual art, music, theatre, and the humanities.

Nathan H. Wilson, the namesake of the Nathan H. Wilson Center for the Arts, was a prominent member of the Florida Community College at Jacksonville District Board of Trustees from 1984 to 1989. During his tenure, he established scholarships for minority students, promoted community outreach activities, and supported the arts. Wilson's dedication to community relations earned him numerous accolades, including the National Conference of Christians and Jews Brotherhood Award and the Book of Golden Deeds award.
