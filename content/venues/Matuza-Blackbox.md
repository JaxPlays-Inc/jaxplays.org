The Matuza Blackbox is a studio performance space located within the [[theatre:Limelight Theatre]] in St. Augustine, Florida. The theater has a seating capacity of 75-90 people and offers a versatile space for experimental, intimate and contemporary performances. The space features state-of-the-art lighting and sound systems, as well as flexible seating arrangements that allow for various staging configurations. The Matuza Blackbox is an important addition to the Limelight Theatre's facilities, providing a smaller venue for more intimate productions and expanding the theater's programming capabilities.

The Limelight Theatre received a Cultural Facilities Grant of $398,000 from the State of Florida in 2006, which funded significant improvements to the building including the creation of the black box space then called the [[venue:Koger-Gamache Studio Theatre]]. The Koger-Gamache Studio Theatre was renamed the Matuza Blackbox in 2024 in honor of Linda and Ray Matuza, long-time supporters and benefactors of the Limelight Theatre.
