Originally constructed in 1898, The Waterworks was the heart of the city’s first water utility. However, its significance doesn't stop at utilitarian roots—by 1928, the building was transformed into Davenport Park, pioneering the concept of adaptive reuse in St. Augustine. It became a communal sanctuary, housing institutions like the St. Augustine Little Theatre and the St. Augustine Garden Club.

Facing potential ruin after its closure in 2005, the building was lovingly restored, thanks to a series of grants. This Phoenix-like resurrection culminated in its 2014 listing on the National Register of Historic Places, an honor that underscores its enduring architectural and historical merit.

Now under the stewardship of the St. Johns Cultural Council, The Waterworks has been reimagined as a dynamic hub for the arts. Recent extensive renovations provide an exceptional venue for a wide array of events, from soul-stirring concerts and provocative literary events to compelling exhibitions and enriching educational programs.

Today, The Waterworks isn't just a building; it's a celebration of heritage, a canvas for the arts, and a focal point for community engagement.
