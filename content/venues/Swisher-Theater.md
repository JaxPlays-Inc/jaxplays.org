The Swisher Theater at Jacksonville University is a state-of-the-art performance venue located on the university's campus in Jacksonville, Florida. The theater features a proscenium stage and seating for up to 640 guests, with excellent sightlines and acoustics. The venue is used for a wide variety of events, including theatrical productions, concerts, dance performances, lectures, and more. With a large stage, advanced lighting and sound systems, and an orchestra pit, the Swisher Theater is well-equipped to host a diverse range of performances. The theater is named after philanthropist T. Edward "Ted" Swisher, who donated generously to the university and served as a trustee. 

The Swisher Theater at Jacksonville University underwent an extensive renovation to modernize and expand the facility in 2006. The renovation project expanded the theater's footprint to 22,000 square feet, providing additional space for an extended stage, orchestra pit, grand lobby, and faculty offices. A new addition at the rear of the theater modernized the backstage area, adding space for a costume shop, makeup room, dressing rooms, scene shop, design studio, tool and paint rooms, and a state-of-the-art sound and intercom system. The renovation also included upgrades to the electrical, mechanical, and plumbing systems for improved functionality and performance. The 400-seat theater is now a state-of-the-art performance venue and educational facility, recognized with an Award of Merit for Design Excellence by the Jacksonville Chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 2008.
