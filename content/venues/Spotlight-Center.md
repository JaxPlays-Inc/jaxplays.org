Opened on April 27, 2023, the Spotlight Events Center is an intimate, high-quality venue offering a range of customizable event and performance options. With seating for 108, the center is a hub for musical and theater performances, complete with dinner options, hosted by the [Theatre Advancement Production Society, Inc. (TAPS)](/theatres/taps-theatre-advancement-production-society), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

Many of the artists gracing the Spotlight stage have roots in Nashville's famed Chaffin's Barn Dinner Theater, where TAPS had been performing and fundraising for various charities since 2010. The Barn, a staple for top-quality shows for 55 years, unfortunately had to close its doors permanently due to the 2020 pandemic.
