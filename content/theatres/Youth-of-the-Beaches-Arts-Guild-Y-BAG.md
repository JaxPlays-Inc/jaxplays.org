The Y-BAG, or Youth of the Beaches Arts Guild, was a program that provided free acting opportunities for children ages 9 to 18 in the Jacksonville Beach area. It operated a summer program of musical theatre, attracting hundreds of participants. However, in 2009, the program was discontinued due to a lack of funding from Jacksonville Beach, the primary contributor.
