Swoop Troupe is a student led organization at the University of North Florida that is entirely dedicated to musical theater. Since musical theatre and dance are not available as a degree program at UNF, students who are passionate about the art form can only show it by their involvement in this club. Swoop Troupe is a club committed to providing UNF students and the Jacksonville community the opportunity to become involved in all aspects of theatrical productions both backstage and on stage.
