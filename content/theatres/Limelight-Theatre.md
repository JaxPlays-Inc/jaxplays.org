The Limelight Theatre is a non-profit community theatre located in St. Augustine, Florida, United States. Founded in 1992 by Anne Kraft and Jean Rahner, the theatre staged its first production at the Monson Bayfront Inn in August of that year.

After achieving non-profit status in 1994, the Limelight Theatre continued to produce shows at various locations around St. Augustine, including a rented building on U.S. 1. In 2001, the theatre was able to purchase a 10,000 square foot building on Old Mission Avenue with the help of a grant from the Joukowsky Family Foundation. The building was converted into a 125-seat theatre, marking the theatre's first permanent home.

In 2006, the Limelight Theatre received a Cultural Facilities Grant of $398,000 from the State of Florida, which was used to fund significant improvements to the building, including a new roof, air-conditioning, heating, sound and lighting systems, lobby and restroom renovations, and the creation of a black box space called the Koger-Gamache Studio Theatre that seats 75-90 people.

The Limelight Theatre is known for its diverse programming, which includes plays, musicals, and other live performances. The theatre also offers year-round theatre education programs for individuals of all ages, from 4 years old and up.

The Limelight Theatre is committed to supporting the local community and often partners with local organizations and charities to promote the arts and raise awareness and funds for important causes. The theatre has become a cultural hub in St. Augustine, drawing audiences from across the region and beyond, and has established a reputation for excellence in the arts.
