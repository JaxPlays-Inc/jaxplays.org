Jacksonville University's Linda Berry Stein College of Fine Arts & Humanities stood as a center of excellence in arts and humanities, enriching Northeast Florida for over six decades before its closure in April 2025. With a faculty of distinguished artists and scholars, the college fostered a dynamic learning environment where arts and humanities intersected. Known for award-winning theatre, dance, and music, as well as intellectual events like the Fiat Lux Film Festival and philosophy slams, the Stein College was a hub for creative and scholarly pursuits. Its commitment to community engagement was evident through partnerships with local arts organizations, providing students with real-world experiences. The college's closure marked a significant loss to the cultural fabric of Jacksonville, ending a legacy of artistic and academic contributions that had shaped countless lives and enriched the community for generations.
