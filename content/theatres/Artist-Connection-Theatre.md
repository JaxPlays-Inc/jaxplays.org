Located in the Arlington area of Jacksonville, Artist Connection Theatre is a non-profit community theatre that strives to produce affordable live theatre that the entire family can enjoy. A.C.T. seeks to foster an environment where actors of any age or experience level can grow and hone and develop their artistic abilities.

In addition to its mainstage performances, Artist Connection Theatre offers educational workshops for kids and teens. These workshops give students the chance to experience the full process of a live musical production, from auditions to the final bow.

Founded in 2017, Artist Connection Theatre began in a church gymnasium. In 2019, the theatre began renovating and preparing to move into 2 units the old cinema and drafthouse at the Gazebo Shopping Center. Artist Connection Theatre officially opened the doors to its new facility in 2021 with its production of The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.
