The Actors Collective was founded by Caryl Butterley, with a focus on presenting theatrical narratives that challenge conventional expectations and elevate marginalized stories. They collaborate with local organizations that align with their mission and goals, while also providing opportunities for theatre artists to receive compensation for their work. As a nomadic group, the Actors Collective communicates with their audience through social media and email.
