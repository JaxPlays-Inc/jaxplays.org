Founded in 2015 by [Daniel Austin](/people/daniel-austin) and [Ron Shreve](/people/ron-shreve), Bold Theatre Group was a Jacksonville-based artist collaborative that aimed to revolutionize the local theater scene. With a mission to act as a torch-bearer for the theatrical spirit, the group specializes in theatrical strategy, ensemble work, and event-based storytelling.

Austin, a San Diego native, and Shreve, originally from Hawaii, bring a unique blend of civic engagement and artistic direction to the group. Both are University of Florida Theatre program graduates and have extensive experience in various roles in the theater community, from directing to acting.

Their debut show, Circle Mirror Transformation, showcased their commitment to innovative storytelling and actor development. The production was not just a performance but an exploration of the art of theater itself, involving theater games and ensemble exercises that connected to the characters and the storyline.
