Orange Park Community Theatre was founded in 1969 by the Orange Park Women's Club, with the first show being "The Night of January 16th" performed in the Clay County Courthouse in Green Cove Springs. After staging their second show in the Orange Park High School Cafetorium, the theatre group moved to the Reynolds Industrial Park facility in 1970, where they stayed until 1981. With the loss of this facility, OPCT began fundraising for a permanent location, ultimately signing a lease for land in February 1982. During this time, the group continued to perform in various local venues, including the Orange Park Lions Club, the Orange Park Public Library, Lakeside Elementary, and Naval Air Station Jacksonville. In 1986, OPCT was able to acquire the St. Marys Catholic Church facility, which was scheduled for demolition, and in April 1987, they moved to their current location at 2900 Moody Avenue. The first performance at this new facility was "Murder Among Friends," and it has remained the home of OPCT ever since.
