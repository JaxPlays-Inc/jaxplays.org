FSCJ Dramaworks is the dynamic production arm of Florida State College at Jacksonville's academic theatre programs. Established in the 1990s, the group has its roots tracing back to the 1960s, evolving from student-led initiatives like the Masques and FJC Players. Operating out of the state-of-the-art Nathan H. Wilson Center for the Arts, Dramaworks produces one major show each in the Spring and Fall, along with an annual student Acting and Directing Showcase. The ensemble has been celebrated both regionally and nationally, including accolades from the Kennedy Center's American College Theatre Festival.
