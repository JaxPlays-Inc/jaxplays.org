The Queer Onstage Project is a queer, student-led theatrical production group dedicated to elevating LGBTQ+ voices and stories to the stage.

We primarily produce new LGBTQ+ plays written by local student playwrights, and our performances aim to be not only events of theatre but also events of community. For example, we often feature local LGBTQ+ vendors at our shows.

We were originally founded in 2024 under the name The Hunger Onstage Project with the goal of producing [[production:2024 Hunger]], a play written by local playwright Ashlyn Colwell, which was unable to be shown in a Florida high school following the consequences of the [[w:Florida_Parental_Rights_in_Education_Act|"Don't Say Gay" law]]. After the success of this first production on May 23rd, 2024, we decided to continue operating under our new name, The Queer Onstage Project, with the broader goal of producing a new student-written LGBTQ+ play every year.
