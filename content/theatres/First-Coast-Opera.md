Founded in 2000, First Coast Opera has become the cornerstone of opera in North Florida, offering an eclectic array of performances for over two decadesâ€”from intimate dinner shows and galas to fully staged productions. The Saint Augustine-based company enjoys support from the Florida Department of Cultural Affairs, St. Johns County, and the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as countless individual contributors.

Over the years, the company has transitioned through different leaderships but has consistently championed local talent in both classic and new operatic works. Under the current guidance of Artistic Director Curtis Tucker and Board President Michele Bova, First Coast Opera has expanded its artistic footprint, paying homage to luminaries such as Marian Anderson, Leonard Bernstein, and Edith Piaf, while also engaging in educational outreach.

The company has further enriched the community through collaborations with various arts organizations, including Flagler College, Stetson University Opera, and the St. Augustine Orchestra. A vital cultural asset, First Coast Opera continues to be an active arts partner, amplifying the artistic voice of the Northeast Florida region.
