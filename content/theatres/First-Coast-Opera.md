For 25 years, First Coast Opera has been bringing the power and beauty of live opera to Northeast Florida. As the region's first opera company, we are dedicated to presenting fully-staged productions, offering audiences the full theatrical experience with the grandeur of orchestra, chorus, sets and costumes. Rounding out each season we offer dinner concerts and free community programs that open the world of opera to all and showcase its remarkable versatility.

As we look to the next 25 years, we invite you to join us in celebrating opera's rich tradition and vibrant future on the First Coast. Our 26th season brings two beloved 19th-century masterpieces, Bizet's 'Carmen' and Gilbert and Sullivan's 'The Mikado.' We look forward to sharing them with longtime supporters and welcoming new audiences into the First Coast Opera family.

The company has further enriched the community through collaborations with various arts organizations, including Flagler College, Stetson University Opera and the St. Augustine Orchestra. A vital cultural asset, First Coast Opera continues to be an active arts partner, amplifying the artistic voice of the Northeast Florida region.
