Founded by Jill and Gregg Dillingham, the Amelia Musical Playhouse (AMP) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit theater located on Amelia Island, Florida. Originating from casual glee nights, AMP has transformed into a lively, volunteer-run hub for performing arts. Offering shows Thursday through Sunday, the playhouse boasts a wide range of musicals, plays, and revues, all accompanied by live music.

AMP is committed to fostering cultural enrichment and social connectivity. With over 140 productions since 2013, including a special "Under the Stars" series during the pandemic, the theater provides performance opportunities for individuals of all ages and experience levels.

The venue operates on "organic scheduling," relying on the creative input of its growing community of volunteers. Open to new members in all aspects of production, AMP is a cornerstone for live theater in the Nassau County area.
