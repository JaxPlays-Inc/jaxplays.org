A Classic Theatre strives to produce plays that are relevant, timely and thought provoking.

Our goal is to entertain, and engage our audience through the performing arts, providing high quality productions to our local community and to the many visitors to our area.

A Classic Theatre takes pride in producing a wide range of offerings that fit its mission of producing classic, contemporary and original works. The season consists of 4 full productions which are performed at the historic Waterworks building in St. Augustine. The season also includes 4 Staged Readings, which are performed at The Center for Spiritual Living.
