Amelia Island Opera (AIO), an artist-led company, was founded in 2021 by opera singers [[person:Victoria Isernia]], [[person:Robyn Marie Lamp]], and [[person:John Tibbetts II]]. When these three talented vocalists found themselves grounded as the COVID-19 pandemic froze everyone in place, they made their way to Amelia Island, Fla. There, they found an arts-friendly community hungry to welcome more classical vocal music to Northeast Florida. Early performances were greeted with great enthusiasm. The three founders recognized a need to create opportunities not only for themselves but also for other world-class emerging artists. Amelia Island offers a perfect place, given the number of arts & culture organizations supported by the community.
